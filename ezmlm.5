.SH NAME
ezmlm \- format of ezmlm directory
.SH OVERVIEW
An
.B ezmlm
directory,
.IR dir ,
stores information about an
.B ezmlm
mailing list.
.B ezmlm-make
creates
.IR dir ;
.B ezmlm-sub
and
.B ezmlm-unsub
manipulate the subscriber list stored under
.IR dir ;
.B ezmlm-manage
handles administrative requests automatically;
.B ezmlm-send
sends a message to all subscribers listed in
.I dir
and also maintains a message archive and message subject index if the list
is configured to do so.
.B ezmlm-reject
rejects messages that have an empty subject, or a subject consisting of
only a command word;
.B ezmlm-return
handles bounces;
.B ezmlm-warn
warns users for which messages bounce and eventually removes them from
the subscriber list.
.B ezmlm-idx
can create a subject index from an existing list archive.
.B ezmlm-get
manages message, index, and thread retrieval from the archive, as well
as the generation of message digests;
.B ezmlm-cron
provides a restricted interface to cron for the generation of
digest generation trigger messages;
.B ezmlm-store
queues messages of moderated lists and sends a moderation request to
the moderator(s);
.B ezmlm-moderate
processes moderation requests to accept the queued message to the list
via
.B ezmlm-send,
or to return the message to the sender;
.B ezmlm-clean
cleans up the moderation queue and returns to the sender
any messages that have timed-out;
.B ezmlm-gate
posts messages that come from a SENDER in an address database, and sends
remaining messages out for moderation;
.B ezmlm-check
is used to diagnose problems with ezmlm mailing list configuration;
.B ezmlm-issub
and
.B ezmlm-issubn
determine if a SENDER is a subscriber or a member of a
collection of addresses;
.B ezmlm-tstdig
determines if it is time to create a new digest based on the number and
volume of messages and the amount of time that has passed since the last
digest was issued;
.B ezmlm-request
can be used to answer
.B ezmlm
commands in the subject line easing migration from other mailing list
managers. It can also function as a global interface mimicking
the interface of other mailing list manager.
.B ezmlm-glmake
can set up the global interface, and
.B ezmlm-glconf
can create a configuration file for the global interface from your lists.
.SH SUBSCRIBERS
.I dir\fB/subscribers
is a directory containing the subscriber list.
.B ezmlm-manage
allows automatic subscription if
.I dir\fB/public
exists.

The list is hashed into 53 files, named
.B @ 
through
.B t
in ASCII.
A nonexistent file is treated as an empty file.

Each file contains a series of addresses.
An address can be any string of non-NUL characters up to 400 bytes long.
Each address is preceded by the letter T and followed by a NUL.

For reliability,
when an address is added to or removed from the mailing list,
the relevant file is recreated under a temporary name
inside
.I dir\fB/subscribers
and then moved into place.

.I dir\fB/key
is a binary file.
.B ezmlm-manage
uses
.I dir\fB/key
to create confirmation numbers.
Anyone who can guess the contents of
.I dir\fB/key
can forge subscription requests.
.B ezmlm-make
does not put much effort into making
.I dir\fB/key
difficult to guess;
for better security, you should add some random garbage to
.IR dir\fB/key .
.SH ARCHIVE
.I dir\fB/archive
is a directory containing messages previously sent to subscribers.
.B ezmlm-send
archives all new messages if
.I dir\fB/archived
exists. If
.I dir\fB/indexed
exists,
.B ezmlm-send
also maintains a message subject and author index.

Messages sent to the mailing list are numbered from 1 upwards,
whether or not they are archived.
.I dir\fB/num
is the number of messages sent so far followed by ':', followed by the
cumulative amount of message body that has passed
.B ezmlm-send
stored as kbytes * 4 (4 corresponds to 1kb).

.I dir\fB/archive
has subdirectories,
each subdirectory storing up to 100 messages.
Message number 100m+n, with n between 0 and 99, is stored in
.IR dir\fB/archive/\fIm\fB/\fIn .
For example, message number 15307 is stored in
.IR dir\fB/archive/153/07 .
The message index is stored in the file
.B index
in the same subdirectory of
.I dir\fB/archive
holding the corresponding messages.
Thus, the subject index contains up to 100 entries.

The subject index contains message subjects that are normalized so that
the original message and all replies have the same entry. The subject index
is used for advanced message retrieval functions. For safety, the subject
index is created under a temporary name
inside
.I dir\fB/archive
and then moved into place.

.B ezmlm-manage
will ignore message files without the owner-execute bit set.
.B ezmlm-send
turns on the owner-execute bit after safely writing the message to disk.

.B ezmlm-make
by default adds
.B ezmlm-get
to
.I dir\fB/manager
to handle 
.I \-get, \-index,
and
.I \-thread
requests. If
.B ezmlm-make
is invoked with a 
.I digcode
command line argument, digest creation
is enabled by putting this argument on the
.B ezmlm-get
command line.
.SH BOUNCES
.I dir\fB/bounce
is a directory containing bounce messages.
.B ezmlm-return
stores several types of files here.
.SH "DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS"
.B ezmlm-make
sets up four files to control mailing list deliveries.
Each file is a series of delivery instructions in
.B dot-qmail
format.

.I dir\fB/editor
handles incoming mailing list submissions.
.B ezmlm-make
sets up
.I dir\fB/editor
to invoke
.B ezmlm-send
to immediately forward each message to all subscribers
and then to run
.BR ezmlm-warn .

.I dir\fB/owner
handles incoming messages for the mailing list's owner.
.B ezmlm-make
sets up 
.I dir\fB/owner
to store messages in
.I dir\fB/Mailbox
and then to run
.BR ezmlm-warn .

.I dir\fB/bouncer
handles incoming bounce messages.
.B ezmlm-make
sets up
.I dir\fB/bouncer
to invoke
.BR ezmlm-return .
.B ezmlm-warn
is no longer invoked here due to the load it places on systems with many
large lists with many bounces.

.I dir\fB/manager
handles incoming administrative requests.
.B ezmlm-make
sets up
.I dir\fB/manager
to invoke
.BR ezmlm-get ,
.BR ezmlm-manage ,
and then
.BR ezmlm-warn .

.I dir\fB/moderator
handles incoming message
.I accept
and
.I reject
requests for moderated lists.
.B ezmlm-make
sets up
.I dir\fB/moderator
to invoke
.BR ezmlm-moderate ,
and .BR ezmlm-clean .
.SH DIGESTS
.B ezmlm-get
can create digests if it is invoked from the command line, from
.IR dir\fB/editor ,
or from
.IR dir\fB/manager .
The program functions in slightly different ways in these 3 settings (see
.BR ezmlm-get(1) ).

To enable automatic digests for a mailing list, use the
.B ezmlm-make \-d
switch. To also enable the generation of digests at specific times dictated
by mailed trigger messages, a
.I digcode
should be specified on the
.B ezmlm-get
command line.
This can be done by specifying
.I digcode
as a fifth argument to
.B ezmlm-make
when setting up the list.
.I digcode
must be alphanumeric and is case-insensitive.

To generate trigger messages, use
.B ezmlm-cron(1)
as an interface to
.B crond(8)
or use
.B crond
directly.

.I dir\fB/num
contains the number of the last message processed, followed by ':' and a
number that is increased by 1 for each 256 bytes of message body text
processed. The latter number is used by
.B ezmlm-tstdig
to determine if a new digest is due.

.I dir\fB/dignum
contains the contents of
.I dir\fB/num
at the time of the last regular digest creation, followed by a ':',
followed by a timestamp.
It is updated after each regular digest is sent.

.I dir\fB/digissue
contains the issue number of the last regular digest. It is incremented
for each regular digest sent.

The following user crontab entry (all on one line)
generates a digest of the list
.I list@host.domain
at 1600 every day:

.EX
  00 16 * * * /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject list-dig.digcode
.EE

Alternatively,
.B ezmlm-cron
can be used:

.EX
  % ezmlm-cron -t 16:00 list@host digcode
.EE

.B ezmlm-get
can also be run from the shell: To generate a digest to
.I list-digest@host
from the list housed in
.IR ~joe/list :

.EX
  % ezmlm-get ~joe/list
.EE

Like other
.B ezmlm-get
replies, digest can be sent in several formats. See
.B ezmlm-get(1)
for more info.
.SH MODERATION
There are three aspects of moderation: moderation of posts, moderation
of subscriptions, and "remote administration", i.e. giving the
moderator the right to (un)subscribe any user.
.B ezmlm
handles these three aspects separately. The two first aspects enhance
security, while the third decreases security, but makes list administration
considerably easier. By default, the moderator database is the same for all
three functions. While "remote administration" and subscription moderation
always use the same database, the moderators for message moderation can
be different.

Even with subscription moderation, the user has to verify the request. This
is to ensure that the user initiating the request really controls the address.
.B ezmlm-manage
options exist to disable the user handshake, which may be useful in some
circumstances.

For moderation options, the moderators are by stored in a subscriber
list in
.IR moddir\fB/subscribers .
By default
.I moddir
is
.IR dir\fB/mod .

Moderators can be added and removed with:

.EX
.B ezmlm-sub
.I moddir
.I moderator@host
.EE

.EX
.B ezmlm-unsub
.I moddir
.I moderator@host
.EE

For subscription moderation, touch
.IR dir\fB/modsub
after adding moderator(s).
For remote administration, touch
.IR dir\fB/remote .
If the contents of these files start with a leading forward slash, it is 
assumed to be the name of
.B moddir
subscription
moderation. If both files exist and start with a forward slash, the
.I dir\fB/remote
contents are ignored. Moderators are stored in a subscriber list in the
.B subscribers
subdirectory of
.BR moddir .
If no directory names are specified,
the default,
.IR dir\fB/mod ,
is used.
In all cases, the
.I subscribers
subdirectory of the base directory must exists/be created.

Moderation of messages is achieved by
creating
.I dir\fB/modpost
and  modifying
.IR dir\fB/editor
to invoke
.B ezmlm-store.
.B ezmlm-store
stores the message in
.IR dir\fB/mod/pending
and sends a moderation request to all moderators stored in
.IR moddir .

If
.I dir\fB/modpost
does not exist,
.B ezmlm-store
posts messages directly, and
.B ezmlm-clean
does nothing.

If
.I dir\fB/modpost
contains a directory name starting with a forward slash,
this directory is used as
.I moddir
for message moderation.
Moderators are stored in a subscriber list in the
.I subscribers
subdirectory of
.IR moddir .
If no directory names are specified,
the default,
.IR dir\fB/mod ,
is used.

.IR dir\fB/moderator
is linked to
.IR dot\fB\-accept-default
and
.IR dot\fB\-reject-default .
It handles replies from the moderators.

In addition to a moderator list, the directories
.IR dir\fB/mod/pending ,
.IR dir\fB/mod/accepted ,
and
.IR dir\fB/mod/rejected
must exist. These directories contain the message moderation queue.

If
.IR dir\fB/mod/modtime
it determines the minimal time in hours that messages wait in the moderation
queue, before they are returned to sender with the message in
.IR dir\fB/text/mod-timeout .

If a
.I \-help
command is send for a moderator and
.IR dir\fB/modsub
or
.IR dir\fB/remote
exist, a more detailed help message stored in
.I dir\fB/text/mod-help
will be sent together with the regular help. This text should not contain
secrets.
If
.I dir\fB/text/mod-help
does not exist,
.I dir\fB/text/help
will be sent.

If a
.I \-list
command is sent for a moderator and
.IR dir\fB/modsub
or
.IR dir\fB/remote
exist, and the
.B ezmlm-manage \-l
command line switch is specified, a subscriber list will be returned.

If an
.I \-edit.file
command is sent for a moderator and
.IR dir\fB/remote
exist, and the
.B ezmlm-manage \-d
command line switch is specified,
.B text\fB/file
is returned together with an
.B ezmlm
cookie. The remote administrator may return an edited version of the
file, which will be stored, provided that the cookie is valid.
See
.B ezmlm-manage(1)
for more info.
.SH TEXT
.I dir\fB/text
is a directory
containing files sent out by
.B ezmlm-manage
in response to administrative requests:
.TP 15
.B top
Introducing
.BR ezmlm .
This is placed at the top of each response.
.TP

.BR ezmlm .
This is placed at the bottom of each response.
.TP
.B sub-confirm
Explaining how to confirm a subscription request.

Acknowledging successful subscription.
.TP
.B sub-nop
Acknowledging a subscription request for an address already
on the mailing list.
.TP
.B sub-bad
Rejecting a bad subscription confirmation number.
.TP

.TP
.B trailer
If this files exists, it is copied to the end of all messages to the list.
.TP
.B faq
Sent in response to the
.I faq
command. Usually contains frequently asked questions and answers specific
for the mailing list.
.TP
.B info
Sent in response to the
.I info
command. Usually contains a descripition, policy, etc, for the list. The
first line should in itself be a very brief description of the list.

.TP
.B bounce-probe
Pointing out that a warning message has bounced.
.TP
.B bounce-num
Explaining that
.B ezmlm-return

.PP
Several tags in the text files are replaced by ezmlm programs.
All programs replace the tag
.B <#l#>
with the name of the list or the list-digest, as appropriate for the request,
and
.B <#h#>
with the hostname for the list.
.B ezmlm-send
and
.B ezmlm-get
replace
.B <#n#>
with the current message number in added headers from
.I dir\fB/headeradd
and text files.
.B ezmlm-get
does this for digest messages, where the current message is the number of
the first message in the digest.
.B ezmlm-manage
replaces the tag
.B <#A#>
anywhere on a line with the subscription address, and
.B <#R#>
anywhere on a line
with the address the subscriber must reply to. Only the first tag on any
line is processed.
.PP
For backwards compatibility,
.B ezmlm-manage
replaces the line
.B !A
in any of these files
with the name of the subscription address.
It replaces the line
.B !R
in
.B sub-confirm
and
.B unsub-confirm
with the address that the subscriber must reply to.
.PP
.B ezmlm-store
replaces the tag
.B <#A#>
anywhere on a line with the address for accepting the message, and
.B <#R#>
anywhere on a line
with the address for rejecting the message.
Only the first tag on any line is processed.
.PP
For backwards compatibility,
.B ezmlm-store
also replaces the line
.B !A
with the address for accepting the message and the line
.B !R
with the address for rejecting the message.
.SH "OUTGOING MESSAGE EDITING"
.I dir\fB/headerremove
is a list of bad header field names,
one per line.
.B ezmlm-send
removes these header fields from all outgoing messages.
.B ezmlm-make
sets up
.I dir\fB/headerremove
to remove
.BR Return-Path ,
.BR Return-Receipt-To ,
and
.B Return-Path
fields.

.I dir\fB/headeradd
is a list of new header fields.
.B ezmlm-send
adds these fields to every outgoing message.
.B ezmlm-send
sets up
.I dir\fB/headeradd
to add
.B X-No-Archive: yes
and
.BR Precedence: bulk .

If
.I dir\fB/mimeremove
exists,
.B ezmlm-send
removed parts with the corresponding content-types from composite MIME
messages. If the
.B ezmlm-reject
.I dir
argument is specified,
simple MIME messages of these content-types are rejected.

If
.I dir\fB/mimereject
exists, and the
.B ezmlm-reject
.I dir
argument is specified,
simple MIME messages of these content-types, or
composite MIME messages with any body part of these content-types are rejected.

If
.I dir\fB/sequence
exists, the first line is added as a header to all outgoing messages, followed
by a space and the message number. The message number is useful for archive
retrievals, since some mail systems do not reveal the return-path to the user.
.B NOTE:
Sublists have their own message counter. Adding a sequence header from a
sublists will give you the sublist message number which is different from
the main list message number.

.I dir\fB/prefix
is a subject prefix. If this file exists, its contents are prefixed to the
subject of the post in the outgoing message. The archived message is not
processed. Attempts are made to not duplicate an existing prefix in replies.
Think twice before using this option.
A prefix takes unnecessary space on the subject line and most mail clients
can easily filter on other headers, such as 'Mailing-List:'. If
.I dir\fB/prefix contains a single '#', this will be replaced by the message
number. The use of this feature is inadvisable and violates internet mail
standards. However, it is very popular in e.g. Japan. If you must use this
feature, make sure you are aware that you may be causing problems to users,
sublists, etc.

.I dir\fB/text/trailer
is a message trailer. If this file exists, it's contents are copied to the 
end of outgoing messages. Only lines terminated with new-line are copied.
No trailer is copied to the archived version of the message.
.SH MISCELLANY
The first line of
.I dir\fB/mailinglist
is a line of text.
.B ezmlm-send
creates a new
.B Mailing-List
field, showing the contents of
.IR dir\fB/mailinglist ,
in every outgoing message.

If
.I dir\fB/listid
exists,
ezmlm programs create a new
.B List-ID
field, showing the contents of the first line of
.IR dir\fB/listid ,
in every outgoing message. The list-id should be unique and within name
space controlled by the owner. It should remain constant even if lists
move and be of the format

.EX
List-ID: optional_text <unique_id.domain>
.EE

This header would result from a
.I dir\fB/listid
file containing ``optional_text <unique_id.domain>''. See
.I http://www.within.com/~chandhok/ietf/listid.shtml
for more info.

The first lines of
.I dir\fB/outlocal
and
.I dir\fB/outhost
give the outgoing name of the mailing list.
These are used by
.B ezmlm-manage
and
.B ezmlm-send
to construct sender addresses for outgoing messages.

The first line of
.I dir\fB/inlocal
gives the incoming name of the mailing list.
This is used by
.B ezmlm-manage
to parse incoming envelopes.
Normally
.I inlocal
is the same as
.IR outlocal ,
but sometimes it is different,
with
.I outlocal\fB@\fIouthost
forwarded to
.IR inlocal .

If
.I dir\fB/sublist
exists,
this mailing list is a sublist,
redistributing messages from a parent mailing list.
The first line of
.I dir\fB/sublist
is the name of the parent list.
This affects the behavior of
.BR ezmlm-send .

If
.I dir\fB/qmqpservers
exists,
.B ezmlm-send
and
.B ezmlm-get
will use
.B qmail-qmqpc(1)
to send posts and digests. Other mail will use the normal qmail mechanism.
If
.B qmail-qmqpc
is modified correctly, server IP addresses listed one per line in
.I dir\fB/qmqpsevers
will be tried in order, rather than the default servers specified in
.IR /var/qmail/control .

If
.I dir\fB/msgsize
exists, it is assumed to contain ``max:min'', where ``max'' is the maximum
size in bytes of an acceptable message body, and ``min'' the corresponding
minimal size. Either will be ignored if zero or omitted. If the
.B ezmlm-reject
command line specifies the list directory, messages not meeting the size
criteria are rejected.

If
.I dir\fB/charset
exists, the first line is assumed to represent a valid MIME character set,
which is used for all outgoing MIME messages sent by
.B ezmlm-get 
and the message moderation programs. The character set string may be suffixed
with ':' and 'Q' or 'B' to send all outgoing
text (ezmlm messages, digest table-of-contents, moderation requests, etc)
encoded in ``Quoted-Printable'' or ``base64'' encoding. By default, no encoding
is done, which may result in the transmission of characters with the high
bit set. When encoding is specified, trigger messages and other parts of the
reply that should not be encoded are sent as separate MIME parts.

.I dir\fB/lock
is an empty file.
Any program that reads or writes the subscriber list,
or adds messages to the archive,
locks
.IR dir\fB/lock .

.I dir\fB/Log
is an advisory log of subscription and unsubscription actions.
.B WARNING:
.B Log
is not protected against system crashes.
Log entries may be missing or corrupted if the system goes down. There is
Log for each of the accessory address databases as well. Thus, the log
for digest subscribers is
.IR dir\fB/digest/Log .
If enabled, these logs can be retrieved by remote administrators (see
.BR ezmlm-manage(1) ).

.I dir\fB/digest
contains items specific for the digest list.

.I dir\fB/digest/subscribers
contains hash files of digest subscriber addresses.

.IR dir\fB/digest/Log ,
.IR dir\fB/digest/bounce ,
.IR dir\fB/digest/lockbounce ,
and
.I dir\fB/digest/lock
have functions for the digest list that mirror that of the corresponding
files in
.IR dir .

.I dir\fB/sql
contains SQL server access information for list that are configured to
use an SQL database for storage.

.I dir\fB/tstdig
is a timestamp used temporarily by
.B ezmlm-tstdig(1)
to coordinate digesting.
