STANDARD EZMLM DATABASE INTERFACE

These files comprise the ezmlm subscriber database interface. issub.c and
subscribe.c are backwards compatible with ezmlm-0.53 in terms of function,
but use a case-insensitive hash for address storage, and take a few
extra args to be plug-in compatible with alternative interfaces. Logging to
the subscriber log (DIR/Log) is done from subscribe.c rather than externally,
and the subscriber from line is logged as well.

searchlog.c allows access to DIR/Log.

putsubs.c does all output of subscriber addresses, both to qmail for subscibers,
moderator sendouts, etc, and to list subscribers in reply to the -list command.

Alternative subscriber db interface routines should perform equivalent services,
and fall back to these services if the alternative interface is not configured,
e.g. if DIR/sql doe not exist.

HOW TO SET UP A CLUSTER OF LIST AND SUBLISTS WITH STD DBS

See FAQ.idx.

See SQL-enabled ezmlm list documentation in FAQ.idx for a different
trade-off between these points.
