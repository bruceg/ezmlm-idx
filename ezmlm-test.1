.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-test
is run from the ezmlm build directory. It will test most of the
functions of most of the programs in ezmlm-idx. The program prints
status and error messages to stdout. It requires that qmail runs on the
host and that mail delivery to a local user functions. The invoking user
should have read and execute permission to the files in the build
directory, and write permission in the current directory.

For testing with an SQL database (see
.BR -p ),
you need to have first created the tables in the database, e.g. using
.BR ezmlm-mktab .
A number of switches allow overriding the default connection information.

.B ezmlm-test
creates a test list in the directory ``__TSTDIR'' (in the current
directory). This directory and ``dot.qmail-__tstlist*'' will be
overwritten/removed by the program. In addition, the file
``__TSTDIR_err'' is created. In cases of error, it often contains the
error message from the failing program.

.B ezmlm-test
should complete without error.
As many invocations of the programs test several functions it is not easy
to determine what went wrong if
.B ezmlm-test
fails. Usually, ``__TSTDIR__err'' gives some leads, but then debugging
of the particular program is required. Usually, this involves recreating
the failing circumstances, including environment variables.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d\fI sqldatabase
If SQL support is tested, use
.I sqldatabase
as the database, overriding the default ``ezmlm''. See
.BR \-p .
.TP
.B \-h\fI host
Connect to an SQL server on
.IR host ,
if an SQL database is used (see
.BR \-p ).
Default is empty, which for most database managers defaults to
localhost/unix socket. To specify a non-default port,
add ``:port'' to the host name.
.TP
.B \-p\fI sqlpassword
Test with SQL support, and use
.I sqlpassword
as the connection password. By default, local databases, rather than an
SQL database are used for testing. To use the SQL database with an
empty password, specify
.BR \-p\ '' .
.TP
.B \-t\fI sqltable
Use
.I sqltable
as the table root name for the SQL database tables, if an SQL database
is used (see
.BR \-p ).
Default is ``list''.
.TP
.B \-u\fI sqluser
Connect as
.I sqluser
to the SQL server, if an SQL database is used (see
.BR \-p ).
Default is ``eztest''.
.SH BUGS
On some systems, some of the tests give a broken pipe error. This is because
code needs to be added to the make_message function to capture error messages.
These errors can be safely ignored for now.
