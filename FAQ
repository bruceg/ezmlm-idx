  11..11..  AAcckknnoowwlleeddggeemmeennttss

  Many ezmlm users have contributed to improvements in ezmlm-idx. These
  are listed in the RREEAADDMMEE..iiddxx file in the ezmlm-idx distribution.
  Others have through questions and suggestions inspired parts in this
  FAQ, or pointed out errors or omissions. Thanks! Direct contributions
  are attributed to the respective authors in the text. Thanks again!


  11..22..  WWhhaatt iiss tthhiiss ddooccuummeenntt??

  This FAQ contains answers to many questions that arise while
  installing ezmlm, ezmlm-idx, and while setting up and managing ezmlm
  mailing lists. See ``'' for a brief summary of what is ezmlm and what
  is ezmlm-idx.

  Many aspects of ezmlm are covered in several places in this FAQ. The
  early sections explain how ezmlm works. Later sections discuss how to
  deal with possible errors/problems. Subsequent sections discuss
  details of customization and list setup in a _H_O_W_T_O form. Finally,
  there are sections on information philosophy for moderated lists and
  on security aspects on ezmlm lists.

  This is an evolving document.  If you find any errors, or wish to
  comment, please do so to the authors.  This FAQ is currently aimed at
  system administrators and knowledgeable users, and heavily weighted
  towards questions specific to the ezmlm-idx add-on.

  If you have problems with the ezmlm-idx package, please start by
  reading the ``man'' pages which come with each program, then this
  document and other ezmlm documentation which is identified here. If
  you have exhausted these resources, try the ezmlm and qmail mailing
  lists and their respective mailing list archives. If you have solved a
  problem not in the documentation, write it up as a proposed section of
  a FAQ and send it to the authors. This way, it can be added to the
  next version of this FAQ.


  11..33..  TTeerrmmiinnoollooggyy

  This document uses a number of terms. Here are the meanings ascribed
  to them by the authors.

     DDIIRR
        The base directory of the list.


     SSEENNDDEERR
        The envelope sender of the message, as passed to ezmlm by qmail
        via the $SENDER environment variable.


     LLOOCCAALL
        The local part of the envelope recipient. For list-get-1@host,
        it is usually _l_i_s_t_-_g_e_t_-_1. If host is a virtual domain,
        controlled by _u_s_e_r_-_s_u_b, then local would be _u_s_e_r_-_s_u_b_-_l_i_s_t_-_g_e_t_-_1.


     mmooddddiirr
        Base directory for moderators.  Moderator E-mail addresses are
        stored in a hashed database in mmooddddiirr//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//. By default,
        ``moddir'' is DDIIRR//mmoodd//.

        To add or remove moderators:


          % ezmlm-sub DIR moddir moderator@host.domain
          % ezmlm-unsub DIR moddir moderator@host.domain





     ddoottddiirr

        The second argument of ezmlm-make is the main .qmail file for
        the list. dotdir is the directory in which this ``dot file''
        resides, i.e. the directory part of the ``dot'' argument. This
        is usually the home directory of the user controlling the list
        (but NOT necessarily of the one creating the list). Thus, _d_o_t_d_i_r
        is ~~aalliiaass// if ``root'' creates a list:


           # ezmlm-make ~alias/list ~alias/.qmail-list ...




     _d_o_t_d_i_r is where the ..eezzmmllmmrrcc file is expected when the ezmlm-
     make(1) ``-c'' switch is used (see ``Customizing ezmlm-make opera-
     tion'').


     eezzmmllmm bbiinnaarryy ddiirreeccttoorryy
        The directory where the ezmlm-binaries are normally stored, as
        defined at compile time in ccoonnff--bbiinn.  This is compiled into the
        programs and does not change just because you have moved the
        program.


     eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11))
        This is a reference to the ezmlm-get.1 man page.  Access it with
        one of the following:


          % man ezmlm-get
          % man 1 ezmlm-get




     or if you have not yet installed ezmlm-idx (replace ``xxx'' with
     the version number):


          % cd ezmlm-idx-0.xxx
          % man ./ezmlm-get.1



     bbaasseeddiirr
        The list directory when referencing the list subscriber address
        database.  For E-mail addresses stored in a set of files within
        DDIIRR//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//, the ``basedir'' is ``DIR''.


     aaddddrreessss ddaattaabbaassee
        A collection of E-mail addresses stored in a set of files within
        the ``subscribers'' subdirectory of the basedir,
        DDIIRR//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//.


     mmeessssaaggee mmooddeerraattoorr
        An address to which moderation requests for posts to the list
        are sent. The moderation requests are formatted with
        ``From:''-``reject'' and a ``To:''-``accept'' default headers
        for moderator replies. A reply to the ``reject'' address leads
        to the rejection of the post. A reply to the ``accept'' address
        leads to the acceptance of the post. Any E-mail address can be a
        moderator E-mail address. Any number of moderator E-mail
        addresses can be used. If a post is sent from a moderator E-mail
        address, the moderation request is sent to that E-mail address
        only. If a post is sent from an E-mail address that is not a
        moderator, a moderation request is sent to all moderators.

        The first reply to the moderation request determines the fate of
        the message. Further requests for the action already taken are
        silently ignored, while a request for the contrary action
        results in an error message stating the actual fate of the
        message. Thus, if you want to ``accept'' the message and it has
        already been accepted, you receive no reply, but if you attempt
        to ``reject'' it, you will receive an error message stating that
        the message already has been accepted.

        Most lists are not message moderated. If they are, the owner is
        usually a ``message moderator'', sometimes together with a few
        other trusted users.

        For an announcement list, it is common to make all the
        ``official announcers'' ``message moderators''. This way, they
        can post securely and ``accept'' their own posts, while posts
        from other users will be sent to this set of ``official
        announcers'' for approval.


     ssuubbssccrriippttiioonn mmooddeerraattoorr
        An E-mail address where subscription moderation requests are
        sent. A subscription moderation request is sent after a user has
        confirmed her intention to subscribe. The subscription
        moderation request is sent to all moderators. As soon as a reply
        to this message is received, the user is subscribed and
        notified. Any E-mail address can be a subscription moderator and
        any number of subscription moderators can be used.

        Unsubscribe requests are never moderated (except when the ezmlm-
        manage(1) ``-U'' flag is used and the sender attempts to remove
        an address other than the one s/he is sending from). It is hard
        to imagine a legitimate mailing list that would want to prevent
        unsubscriptions.


     rreemmoottee aaddmmiinniissttrraattoorr
        When a remote administrator subscribes or unsubscribes a list
        member, the ``confirm'' request is sent back to the remote
        administrator, rather than to the subscriber's E-mail address.
        This allows the remote administrator to (un)subscribe any list
        member without the cooperation of the subscriber at that
        address. Any E-mail address can be a remote administrator and
        any number of E-mail addresses can be remote administrators.

        The set of E-mail addresses that are ``remote administrators''
        and ``subscription moderators'' are always the same. This set of
        E-mail addresses can be ``remote administrators'',
        ``subscription moderators'' or both.

        For most lists, the owner would be the ``remote administrator'',
        if s/he wishes to moderate messages, the owner would be the
        ``message moderator'' and if s/he wishes to moderate
        subscriptions the owner would also be the ``subscription
        moderator''.

        The list's ``message moderator(s)'' can be the same, but can
        also be set up to be completely different.


     CChhaannggiinngg lliisstt ````oowwnneerrsshhiipp''''
        Within this FAQ there are references to the need to check or
        change the list ``ownership.'' This is not a reference to the
        individual user who is the ``list-owner'', but a reference to
        the ownership of the files by your operating system which make
        up the list and reside in DDIIRR//.

        To change the ownership of DDIIRR// and everything within:

  ezmlm-0.53 is a qmail-based mailing list manager written by Dan J.
  Bernstein.  It has all the basic functionality of a mailing list
  manager, such as subscriber address management including automated
  bounce handling as well as message distribution and archiving.

  ezmlm-idx is an add-on to ezmlm. It adds multi-message threaded
  message retrieval from the archive, digests, message and subscription
  moderation, and a number of remote administration function. It
  modifies the configuration program ezmlm-make(1) so that it uses a
  text file template rather than compiled-in texts in list creation. In
  this manner, ezmlm-idx allows easy setup of lists in different
  languages and customization of default list setup. ezmlm-idx also adds
  MIME handling, and other support to streamline use with languages
  other than English. As an ezmlm add-on, ezmlm-idx does not work
  without ezmlm and tries to be compatible with ezmlm as much as
  possible.  ezmlm-idx also modifies the ezmlm subscriber database to be
  case insensitive to avoid many unsubscribe problems.

  New in ezmlm-idx-0.40 are better support for announcement lists,
  support for QMQP to offload message distribution onto external hosts,
  simplified optional SQL database use (MySQL or PostgreSQL), more
  flexibility in determining which messages should be moderated, a WWW
  interface to the list archives, and many small improvements.

  ezmlm-idx-0.32 adds improved handling of very large lists with
  optimized bounce handling, ezmlm-split(1) for forwarding (un)subscribe
  requests to sublists to allow sublisting transparent to the
  subscriber, and SQL support to allow sublisting with improved message
  authentication and monitoring of list function, as well as dynamic
  addition/removal/reconfiguration of sublists. Also, subscriber
  ``From:'' lines are logged with support for finding a subscription
  address from a name. The qmail DEFAULT variable is used, if present.
  Together, these additions eliminate the most common problems making
  ezmlm use and administration even easier.

  This document is a FAQ for ezmlm-idx. However, many of the basic items
  that are discussed also apply to ezmlm per se. Referring to the two
  paragraphs above, it should be relatively easy to figure out which
  features require ezmlm-idx.

        ezmlm-idx releases are numbered ``ezmlm-idx-0.xy[z]''.  Versions
        with the same ``x'' are backwards compatible. A change in ``x''
        signifies major changes, some of which _m_a_y require list changes
        (see UPGRADE). However, backwards compatibility with
        ezmlm-0.53 list will be maintained. Thus, this is an issue only
        if you are already using an older version of ezmlm-idx.

        Addition of ``z'' are bug fixes only. Thus, ezmlm-idx-0.301 is
        ezmlm-idx-0.30 with known bugs fixed (but no other significant
        changes).  When available, patches are named
        ``filename-0.xy[z].diff'', where ``0.xy[z]'' corresponds to the
        release to which they apply.  When a number of bugs (or a
        significant bug) are found a bug-fix release is made
        incorporating all the patches for the previous version.

        To get the latest features, look for the highest number (``e.g.
        ezmlm-idx-0.40''). Any bugs in versions with new features are
        expected to be limited to the new features.

        To get the most solid version, get the highest 3-digit number,
        i.e. a bug fix. If you already run a version in that series and
        a new bug fix is released, see CHANGES to determine if it is
        worthwhile to upgrade. Most bugs so far have been relevant only
        when using lists in very unusual ways or with rarely used
        options.

        The latest versions at the time of release of a package are
        included in that package. Thus, this directory will have a file
        labeled with the current ezmlm-idx version number only if it has
        been updated later than the package.  ezmlmrc(5) files are
        updated and new ones are added all the time, also with bug fix
        releases. Therefore, always look at the latest package. Please
        note that ezmlmrc may change significantly between versions.
        Thus, do not expect the ezmlm-idx-0.324 ezmlmrc.es to work with
        ezmlm-idx-0.40.

        ezmlmrc(5) files contain some release-specific configurations.
        Do not use a later file (other than from bug fix releases) with
        an earlier version of the programs. It is usually OK to use a
        version from an earlier package (see UPGRADE), but some new
        functionality may nor be available.

        To contribute an ezmlmrc(5) file in a new language, start with
        the en_US version from the latest package, and send the gzipped
        file to bruce@untroubled.org. Please leave comments intact and
        in English and do not change the order of items in the file.
        This will facilitate maintenance.

  ezmlm-idx>=0.23 writes DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg in a standard format.  If ezmlm-
  make(1) is invoked with the ``-e'' or ``-+'' switch and the ``DIR''
  argument only, ezmlm-make(1) will read other arguments from this file.
  The difference between the switches is that with ``-e'' the options
  used are the ones specified on the command line, whereas with ``-+''
  they are the ones currently active for the list, as overridden by any
  command line options.  Thus, with just:


               % ezmlm-make -+ DIR




  you can rebuild the list, without affecting any archives, list state
  variables, etc. You will _l_o_s_e _m_a_n_u_a_l _c_u_s_t_o_m_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_s _t_o _s_o_m_e _o_f _y_o_u_r
  _f_i_l_e_s. However, text files and DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerraadddd are protected against
  being overwritten, so that your manual customizations of these files
  are retained. To override this protection, simply specify the used
  edit switch twice, e.g. ``-ee'' and ``-++'', respectively. This is a
  feature introduced in ezmlm-idx-0.40.

  To test a new version of ezmlm-idx or to run several version, make the
  new version as per IINNSSTTAALLLL..iiddxx (if you haven't used ezmlm-idx before)
  or UUPPGGRRAADDEE..iiddxx (if you've got a previous version of ezmlm-idx
  installed), setting ccoonnff--bbiinn to a new directory. You can use either
  the current directory or any other directory. If not using the current
  dir, you also have to:


               % make setup




  If you now edit the list using the new ezmlm-make program, the list
  will automatically be configured to use the new binaries. To change
  back to the ``default'' installation, just edit the list again, this
  time with the old ezmlm-make(1).

  If your system has an //eettcc//eezzmmllmmrrcc file, you may need to temporarily
  place the eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) file for the ezmlm version you want to test in
  ddoottddiirr of the list and use the ezmlm-make(1) ``-c'' switch (see
  ``Terminology: dotdir'').

  ezmlm-idx>=0.314 comes with ezmlm-test(1), a program that tests most
  functions of ezmlm+idx and can  be used before installation.


  22..  QQuuiicckk ssttaarrtt


  1. Create a use ``eztest'' for testing. If you use another name, add
     the switch ``-u another_name'' to the ezmlm-test(1) line below.
     (The space between the switch and the argument is required.)

  2. Unpack the ezmlm-0.53 distribution.

  3. Unpack the ezmlm-idx distribution.

  4. Move the ezmlm-idx files to the ezmlm-0.53 directory.

  5. Edit ccoonnff--bbiinn and ccoonnff--mmaann to reflect the target directories.

  6. build and install:


               % cd ezmlm-0.53
               % patch < idx.patch
               % make; make man
               % su
               # su eztest
               % ./ezmlm-test
               % exit
               # make setup
               # exit




  7. Make a list and digest list





          % ezmlm-make -rdugm -5 me@host ~/list ~/.qmail-list me-list host
          % ezmlm-sub ~/list me@host
          % ezmlm-sub ~/list digest me@host
          % ezmlm-sub ~/list mod me@host




  where ``me'' is your user name and ``host'' the host your list is on.

  Now, you are the owner, remote administrator, and subscriber of both
  list@host and the accompanying digest list list-digest@host. Only
  subscribers are allowed to access the archive and to post. To post to
  the list, mail to list@host. For a user to subscribe, s/he should mail
  to list-subscribe@host and for help to list-help@host.

  When a non-subscriber posts, you will be asked to approve, reject, or
  ignore the request. If you want to subscriber joe@joehost.dom, mail
  list-subscribe-joe=joehost.dom@host.

  Digests are generated about every two days, when 30 messages have
  arrived since the last digest, or when more than 64 kbytes of message
  body has arrived. To manage the digest list, use the same commands as
  the main list, but replace ``list'' with ``list-digest''.

  The sender restriction on posting used in this setup works, but is not
  secure. For more info, read the man pages (start with ezmlm(5) and
  ezmlm-make(1)), this FAQ (FFAAQQ..iiddxx in the distribution),

  Thanks to the program execution mechanism Dan built into qmail, it is
  easy to execute several small programs per delivery in a defined
  sequence. It is also very easy to add shell scripts for further
  customization.

  Dan J. Bernstein has written ezmlm in C. It is written for speed and
  reliability even in the face of power loss and NFS.  These features
  are augmented to a large extent by the ruggedness of the qmail (also
  by Dan) delivery mechanism (see qmail-command(8)).

  ezmlm uses some routines and techniques that still are not frequently
  seen in many mailing list managers. For example, subscriber E-mail
  addresses are stored in a hash so that searches require reading only,
  at most, 2% of the E-mail addresses.  ezmlm has a optional message
  archive, where messages are stored 100 per directory, again to allow
  more efficient storage and retrieval. Important files are written
  under a new name and, only when safely written, moved in place, to
  assure that crashes do not leave the list in an undefined state.

  In addition, ezmlm has a number of new inventions. One of these is
  bounce detection, which generates an automatic warning containing
  information identifying the messages which have bounced, followed by a
  probe message to the E-mail addresses for which mail has bounced.  If
  the probe bounces, the address is unsubscribed. Thus, the system won't
  remove E-mail addresses due to temporary bounces: it takes 12 days
  after the first bounce before a warning is sent, and another 12 days
  of bounces after the warning bounce before the probe message is set.

  Another Dan J. Bernstein invention is the use of cryptographic cookies
  based on a timestamp, address, and action. These are used to assure
  that the user sending a request to subscribe or unsubscribe really
  controls the target address.  It is also used to prevent forgery of
  warning or probe messages to make it exceedingly difficult to subvert
  the bounce detection mechanism to unsubscribe another user.

  See qmail(7), qmail-local(8), qmail-command(8), envelopes(5), and dot-
  qmail(5).  Briefly, qmail having resolved the delivery address
  delivers it via the ..qqmmaaiill file that most completely matches the
  address. This file may be a link to another file, as is the case in
  ezmlm lists. qmail then delivers the message according to successive
  lines in this file forwarding it to an address, storing it, or piping
  it to a program. In the latter case, the program is expected to exit 0
  leading delivery to proceed to the next line in the ..qqmmaaiill file, or 99
  leading to success without delivery to succeeding lines. An exit code
  of 100 is a permanent error leading to an error message to the SENDER.
  An exit code of 111 is used for temporary errors, leading to re-
  delivery until successful or until the queue lifetime of the message
  has been exceeded.

  Delivery granularity is the ..qqmmaaiill file and re-deliveries start at the
  top. Thus, if the message fails temporarily at a later line, the
  delivery according to an earlier line will be repeated. Similarly,
  qmail may have made deliveries successfully according to most of the
  ..qqmmaaiill file and then fail permanently. The SENDER is informed that the
  delivery failed, but not about at which point.

  ezmlm takes advantage of these basic mechanisms to build a fast,
  efficient, and very configurable mailing list manager from a set of
  small independent programs.

  Messages to the list are delivered to a ..qqmmaaiill file, usually ~~//..qqmmaaiill--
  lliissttnnaammee which is linked to DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr.  Here, the message is first
  delivered to ezmlm-reject(1) which can reject messages based on
  subject line contents, MIME content-type, and message body length. It
  also by default rejects all messages that do not have the list address
  in the ``To:'' or ``Cc:'' header. This eliminates most bulk spam. If
  the list is set up for restrictions based on envelope SENDER, the next
  delivery is to one or more instances of ezmlm-issubn(1).  If the
  messages passed this check, it is usually delivered to ezmlm-send(1)
  for distribution.  If the list is message moderated, it is instead
  delivered to ezmlm-store(1) which queues the message and sends out a
  moderation request.  ezmlm-gate(1) is used by some other setups. It
  will for message moderated lists invoke ezmlm-send(1) directly if the
  message is from a specific set of SENDERs, and in other cases ezmlm-
  store(1) to send the message out for moderation.

  You can specify a separate ..qqmmaaiill-like file for ezmlm-gate(1).  The
  lines will be executed and the return codes determine if the message
  is rejected, sent to the list, or sent to the moderator. See man page
  for details.

  If the list is configured for digests, DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr also contains an
  ezmlm-tstdig(1) line followed by an ezmlm-get(1) line. If ezmlm-
  tstdig(1) determines that the criteria are met for digest generation,
  it exits with an exit code of 0, causing the ezmlm-get(1) line to be
  executed leading to a digest mailing. Otherwise, ezmlm-tstdig(1) exits
  99, resulting in the remainder of the DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr file to be ignored
  too long. The digest is not related to the message being delivered,
  but the delivery is used to trigger execution of the relevant
  programs.


  In addition, DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr contains a number of house-keeping functions.
  These are invocations of ezmlm-warn(1) to send out bounce warnings and
  and (if the list is moderated) ezmlm-clean(1) to clean the moderation
  queue of messages that have been ignored. Again, these functions are
  not related to the specific message delivered, but the delivery itself
  is used as a convenient ``trigger'' for processing.

  Replies to moderation requests are channeled to DDIIRR//mmooddeerraattoorr. This
  file contains an invocation of ezmlm-moderate(1) which invokes ezmlm-
  send(1) for accepted messages and sends out a rejection notice for
  rejected messages.  It also sends error messages if the message is not
  found or already accepted/rejected _c_o_n_t_r_a_r_y to the moderation message.
  Thus, if you accept a message already accepted, no error message is
  sent. ezmlm-clean(1) is also invoked from DDIIRR//mmooddeerraattoorr for house
  keeping.

  Administrative requests for both list and digest lists are captured by
  ~~//..qqmmaaiill--lliissttnnaammee--ddeeffaauulltt linked to DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr.  Here they are
  delivered first to ezmlm-get(1) which processed archive retrieval
  requests, exiting 99 after successful completion which causes the rest
  of the delivery lines to be ignored. If the request is not for ezmlm-
  get(1) it rapidly exits 0. This leads to invocation of ezmlm-manage(1)
  which handles subscriber database functions, help messages, and (if
  configured) editing of DDIIRR//tteexxtt// files. Again, ezmlm-warn(1) lines are
  included for bounce directory processing.

  If configured, an ezmlm-request(1) line is present. This program
  constructs valid ezmlm requests from command in the subject lines of
  messages sent to listname-request@host and exits 99. These requests
  are mailed and will then return to be processed by one of the other
  programs.

  Bounces to the list are handled by DDIIRR//bboouunncceerr. For the digest list
  this is DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt//bboouunncceerr. The two were combined in previous
  versions, which is still supported. As this leads to problems with
  list names ending in ``digest'', the functions are separate with lists
  set up or edited with ezmlm-idx>=0.32. The bounce is first delivery is
  to ezmlm-weed(1) which removes delivery delay notification and other
  junk. The second to ezmlm-return(1) which analyzes valid bounces
  storing the information in DDIIRR//bboouunnccee// for the list and
  DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt//bboouunnccee// for the digest.  This is the information that
  ezmlm-warn(1) (invoked from DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr and DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr) uses and
  processes for automatic bounce handling.  ezmlm-return(1) will also
  unsubscribe a subscriber from whom a probe message has bounced.

  These are processed by DDIIRR//oowwnneerr and delivered to DDIIRR//mmaaiillbbooxx by
  default. It is better to put the real owner address in this location.
  This can be done manually, via editing of eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)), or via the
  ezmlm-make(1) -5 switch. Again, some house-keeping functions are also
  executed.


  44..1111..  SSttrruuccttuurree ooff ssuubbssccrriibbeerr ddaattaabbaasseess..

  ezmlm subscriber E-mail addresses are stored within DDIIRR//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//
  as a hashed set of 53 files. The hash calculated from the address
  determines which of the 53 files and address is stored in. Thus, to
  find out if an address is a subscriber, ezmlm has to read at most
  about 2% of the E-mail addresses.  The hash function insures that E-
  mail addresses are reasonably evenly distributed among the 53 files.

  Addresses in the files in DDIIRR//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss// are stored as strings
  starting with ``T'', followed by the address, followed by a zero byte.
  This is the same format as taken by qmail-queue(8) on file descriptor
  1.  Thus, subscriber lists can be directly copied to qmail without any
  further processing.

  With ezmlm-idx>=0.32 you can use an SQL server for the subscriber
  databases.  Please see the SQL section (``ezmlm support for SQL
  datbases'').

  rfc822 states that the host part of an address is case insensitive,
  but that case of the local part should be respected and the
  interpretation of it is the prerogative of the machine where the
  mailbox exists.  Thus, ezmlm preserves the case of the local part, but
  converts the host part to lower case. ezmlm proper also bases the hash
  on the case of the local part, so that USER@host and user@host are not
  (usually) stored in the same file.

  Locally, deliveries are most often case insensitive, i.e. mail to
  USER@host and user@host are delivered to the same mail box. A
  consequence of this is that many users use E-mail addresses with
  different case interchangeably.  The problem is that when USER@host is
  subscribed, ezmlm will not find that address in response to an
  unsubscribe request from user@host. This is even more problematic when
  E-mail addresses have been added by hand to e.g. moderator lists.

  ezmlm-idx>=0.22 changes address storage to make comparisons case
  insensitive and store E-mail addresses based on the hash of the all
  lower case address. Case is maintained for the local part. Thus, if
  USER@host is subscribed, mail is set to USER@host, but user@host is
  recognized as a subscriber and an unsubscribe request from user@host
  will remove USER@host from the subscriber list.

  To maintain backwards compatibility with old subscriber lists, a
  second lookup is made for partially upper case E-mail addresses in
  some cases. This will find USER@host subscribed with a case sensitive
  hash as well.

  If may be useful to move all old mixed case E-mail addresses to the
  ``new'' positions.  Without this, USER@host subscribed with the old
  system will be able to unsubscribe as USER@host, but not as user@host.
  After the repositioning, s/he will be successfully able to use any
  case in an unsubscribe request, e.g. UsEr@host. To do this:



       % ezmlm-list DIR | grep -G '[A-Z]' > tmp.tmp
       % xargs ezmlm-sub DIR < tmp.tmp




  This works, because subscribing an address, even if it already exists,
  will assure that it is stored with a case insensitive hash. On some
  systems, the grep ``-G'' switch need/should not be used.


  44..1133..  TTeessttiinngg SSEENNDDEERR ttoo aallllooww ppoossttss oonnllyy ffrroomm lliisstt ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss..

  This mode of operation is automatically set up if you specify the
  ezmlm-make(1) ``-u'' switch. Since there may be some addresses that
  should be allowed to post, but are not subscribers of list or list-
  digest, ezmlm-make(1) sets up an additional address database in
  DDIIRR//aallllooww//.  Use ezmlm-sub(1), ezmlm-unsub(1), and ezmlm-list(1) to
  manipulate these addresses. If the list is configured for remote
  administration (see ``How remote administration works''), you can
  add/remove addresses from the DDIIRR//aallllooww// database by mailing list-
  allow-subscribe@listhost and list-allow-unsubscribe@listhost,
  respectively. Other commands that access subscriber databases work in
  the same manner.

  To similarly restrict archive access, use the ezmlm-make(1) ``-g''
  switch.

  Since SENDER is under the control of a potential attacker, it is not
  secure to use tests of SENDER for anything important. However, when
  replies are always sent to SENDER (such as for archive access), a
  check of SENDER can prevent the sending of information to E-mail
  addresses not in the database.

  To test sender, use the program ezmlm-issubn(1). It will return 0
  (true for the shell, success for qmail deliveries) if SENDER is in at
  least one of a set of subscriber databases. If not, it will return 99
  (false for the shell: success, but skip remainder of ..qqmmaaiill file for
  qmail deliveries). The basedirs of the subscriber lists (i.e. the
  directories in which the ``subscriber'' dirs are located) are given as
  arguments.  ezmlm-issubn(1) can take any number of arguments.

  Thus, to permit an action if SENDER is a subscriber to the list in any
  of DDIIRR//, DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt//, or DDIIRR//aallllooww// and exit silently, put the
  following into the relevant ..qqmmaaiill file:




  |/usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-issubn DIR DIR/digest DIR/allow [...]
  |/path/action_program




  Restricting your list to posts from your subscribers is as easy as
  that. If your ezmlm binaries are in a different directory, you may
  have to modify the ezmlm-issubn(1) path.

  ezmlm-issubn(1) has a ``-n'' switch which ``negates/reverses'' the
  exit code.  To do an action if SENDER is _N_O_T a subscriber of any of
  the lists:



       |/usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-issubn -n DIR/deny [dir2 ...]
       |/path/other_program




  To automatically configure the list with a blacklist address database
  in DDIIRR//ddeennyy, use the ezmlm-make(1) ``-k'' switch. If the list is
  configured for remote administration (see ``How remote administration
  works'') and if you are a remote administrator, you can manipulate the
  ``deny'' database remotely by sending mail to list-deny-subscribe-
  user=userhost@listhost, etc.

  Each ezmlm list has it's own ``key'' created by ezmlm-make at setup
  time.  This key is stored in DDIIRR//kkeeyy, and you can improve it by adding
  garbage of your own to it. However, changing the key will make all
  outstanding cookies invalid, so this should be done when the list is
  established.

  When ezmlm receives an action request, such as ``subscribe'', it
  constructs a cookie as a function of:

  +o  the request,

  +o  the time,

  +o  and the target address.

     The cookie and these items are then assembled into a address that
     is sent out as the ``Reply-To:'' address in the confirmation
     request sent to the subscriber. When the subscriber replies, ezmlm
     first checks if the timestamp is more than 1,000,000 seconds old
     (approx 11.6 days) and rejects the request if it is. Next, ezmlm
     recalculates the cookie from the items.  If the cookies match, the
     request is valid and will be completed. Depending on the
     circumstances, ezmlm generates an error message or a new cookie
     based on the current time and sends the target a new confirmation
     request.

  Dan has based these cookies on cryptographic functions that make it
  very unlikely that a change in any part of the cookie or the items
  will result in a valid combination. Thus, it is virtually impossible
  to forge a request even for someone who has a number of valid requests
  to analyze. Since the algorithm ezmlm uses is available, the security
  rests on the key (and the correctness of the algorithm). Anyone who
  knows the key for your lists can easily construct valid requests.

  As ezmlm-make(1) doesn't use a truly random process to generate the
  key, it is theoretically possible that someone with sufficient
  knowledge about your system can guess your key. In practice, this is
  very unlikely, and the safety of the system is orders of magnitude
  higher than that of other mechanisms that you may rely on in your list
  management and mail transport (exclusive of strong encryption, such as
  _P_G_P).

  Moderator E-mail addresses are stored just like ezmlm subscriber

  subdirectory of the list's bbaasseeddiirr//.  For subscribers, the bbaasseeddiirr// is

  Subscription moderation is a simple extension of the ezmlm subscribe
  mechanism. Once the user has confirmed the subscribe request, a new
  request is constructed with a _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_t _a_c_t_i_o_n _c_o_d_e. This is sent out
  to the moderator(s). When a moderator replies with a valid request and
  cookie combination, the user is subscribed. The user is then also
  welcomed to the list. Other moderators won't know that the request has
  already been approved. If other moderators reply to the request, no
  notification of the duplicate action is sent to the subscriber of the
  duplicate action. Ezmlm knows that this is a repeat request since the
  target address is already a subscriber.

  The moderators are not informed about the result, unless there was an
  error (subscribing a target that is already a subscriber is not
  considered an error). This cuts down the number of messages a
  moderator receives. Any list moderator knows (or _s_h_o_u_l_d know) the
  qmail/ezmlm/unix paradigm: _i_f _y_o_u_'_r_e _n_o_t _t_o_l_d _o_t_h_e_r_w_i_s_e_, _y_o_u_r _c_o_m_m_a_n_d

  used to some other operating systems, but in our experience it doesn't
  take long to get used to the reliability and efficiency of
  U*ix/qmail/ezmlm.

  Subscription moderation is enabled by creating DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb and adding
  the subscription moderator to DDIIRR//mmoodd//:


       % ezmlm-sub DIR mod moderator@host




  To use an alternative basedir for subscription moderators, place that
  directory name with a leading ``/'' in DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb.

  The term ``remote administration'' is used to denote the ability of a
  list administrator by E-mail to add or remove any E-mail address from
  the subscriber list without the cooperation of the user. Normally,
  when user@userhost sends a message to list-subscribe-
  other=otherhost@listhost to subscribe other@otherhost, the
  confirmation request goes to other@otherhost. However, if remote
  administration is enabled and user@userhost is a moderator, a
  confirmation request (with a different action code) is sent back to
  user@userhost instead. The reply from the administrator is suppressed
  in the welcome message sent to the new subscriber (other@otherhost).
  This protects the identity of the remote administrator.

  Remote administration is enabled by creating DDIIRR//rreemmoottee and adding the
  remote administrator E-mail address(es) to DDIIRR//mmoodd//:


       % ezmlm-sub DIR mod remoteadm@host




  To use an alternative basedir for remote administrators, place that
  directory name with a leading ``/'' in DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb.  Remote administra-
  tors and subscription moderators databases always consist of the same
  E-mail addresses.  If both are enabled and one of DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb and
  DDIIRR//rreemmoottee contains an alternative basedir name, this basedir is used
  for both functions.  If both DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb and DDIIRR//rreemmoottee contain direc-
  tory names, the one in DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb is used for both functions.

  Remote administrators can add and remove addresses to the digest list,
  the ``allow'' list (user aliases for lists using SENDER restrictions
  on posting and archive access), and if used the ``deny'' list
  containing addresses that are denied posting rights to the list. The
  latter is easy to circumvent and intended to block errant mail robots,
  rather than human users.

  ezmlm-store(1), invoked in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr, receives messages for message
  moderated lists. If DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt does not exist, ezmlm-store(1) just
  calls ezmlm-send(1) and the message is posted to the list as if it
  were not moderated.  If DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt exists, ezmlm-store(1) places the
  message in DDIIRR//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg//.  It also sends a moderation request to
  all the moderators. Included with this request is a copy of the
  message.  The ``From:'' and ``Reply-To:'' E-mail addresses contain
  codes for ``reject'' and ``accept'', together with a unique message
  name (derived from the message timestamp and process id) and a cookie
  based on these items.  When a moderator replies, ezmlm-moderate(1) is
  invoked via DDIIRR//mmooddeerraattoorr.  ezmlm-moderate(1) validates the request,
  and if the request is valid and the message is found in
  DDIIRR//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg//, it carries out the requested action.

  If the request is ``reject'' the post is returned to SENDER with an
  explanation and an optional moderator comment. If the request is
  ``accept'' the message is posted to the list via ezmlm-send(1). As the
  request is processed, a stub for the message is created in
  DDIIRR//mmoodd//rreejjeecctteedd// or DDIIRR//mmoodd//aacccceepptteedd// for ``reject'' and ``accept''
  requests, respectively.

  If a valid reply is received but the message is no longer in
  DDIIRR//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg//, ezmlm-moderate(1) looks for the corresponding stub
  in DDIIRR//mmoodd//rreejjeecctteedd// and DDIIRR//mmoodd//aacccceepptteedd//.  If the stub is found and
  the fate of the message was the one dictated by the new request, no
  further action is taken. If, however, no stub is found or the request
  and the actual message fate do not match, a notification is sent to
  the moderator. This scheme was chosen to impart a maximum of
  information with a minimum of messages. Also, it is the least
  demoralizing setup for multiple moderator lists, where it is important
  not to notify subsequent moderators that their work was in vain since
  the action of the first responding moderator has already resulted in
  processing of the message.

  If a message is not ``rejected'' or ``accepted'' it remains in
  DDIIRR//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg// until it times out. Cleanup of both messages and
  stubs is accomplished by ezmlm-clean(1) which is invoked through both
  DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr and DDIIRR//mmooddeerraattoorr for message moderated lists. ezmlm-
  clean(1) looks at the timestamp used to generate the message/stub
  name. If it is older than 120 hours (configurable in a range of 24-240
  hours, by placing the value in DDIIRR//mmooddttiimmee) it is removed.  Unless
  suppressed with the ezmlm-clean(1) ``-R'' switch, the SENDER of the
  message is notified.

  By default, the E-mail addresses of message moderators are stored as a
  subscriber list with a basedir of DDIIRR//mmoodd//.  This can be changed to
  any other bbaasseeddiirr by placing the name of that directory with a leading
  ``/'' in DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt.  Although the default basedirs for message
  moderation and subscription moderation/remote administration are the
  same, both the functions and actors are entirely independent.

  qmail processes messages on a first-come-first-served basis. This
  means that when it receives a post to 100,000 subscribers, it will try
  all the recipients before processing the next message. Often, it is
  desirable to offload this work to an external host so that the main
  list host remains responsive to e.g. ``subscribe'' and archive access
  commands, as well as to other mail is it is not a dedicated mail host.

  ezmlm-idx allows the main distribution work to be offloaded to an
  external server via the QMQP protocol. Configure qmail-qmqpc(1) on the
  list host, and qmail-qmqpd(1) on the mail host (see qmail docs for
  details), then create the file DDIIRR//qqmmqqppsseerrvveerrss//00. The list housed in
  DDIIRR will now use the QMQP server for posts, by the local qmail for
  other messages. If you apply the qmail-qmqpc.tar.gz patch (included in
  the ezmlm-idx distribution), you can specify the QMQP server IP
  addresses, one per line, in DDIIRR//qqmmqqppsseerrvveerrss//00, just as you normally
  would in //vvaarr//qqmmaaiill//ccoonnttrrooll//qqmmqqppsseerrvveerrss.  If the first server cannot
  be contacted, the installation will try the second, and so on. The
  advantage of controlling the servers locally is that you can specify
  different servers for different lists. A good idea is to set up also
  the list host as a QMQP server and use that as the last IP address.
  This way, the list host will be used if the main QMQP server cannot be
  contacted. Of course, ezmlm does not loose messages, but rather lets
  qmail redeliver the post if no QMQP server is available.

  The structure of the ezmlm list archive is described in the ezmlm(5)
  manual page.  Basically, the message is stored in DDIIRR//aarrcchhiivvee//nn//mm,
  where ``n'' is the message number divided by 100 and ``m'' the
  remainder (2 digits). The first message is stored in DDIIRR//aarrcchhiivvee//00//0011.


  44..2211..  HHooww tthhee mmeessssaaggee iinnddeexx wwoorrkkss..

  The ezmlm-idx(1) adds the option (default) of a message index to
  ezmlm.  The ``From:'' line, the subject, the author's E-mail address
  and name and the time of receipt are logged for each message as it is
  received. The subject is ``normalized'' by concatenating split lines
  and removing reply-indicators such as ``Re:''. A hash of the
  normalized subject with all white space removed is also stored.  The
  hash for any message within a thread is almost always the same and is
  used together with the order of receipt to connect a set of messages
  into a ``thread''. A hash is needed due to the inconsistent handling
  by MUAs of white space in rfc2047-encoded subject headers.

  The message index is stored as DDIIRR//aarrcchhiivvee//nn//iinnddeexx, where ``n'' is the
  message number mod 100.  Thus, the directory DDIIRR//aarrcchhiivvee//5522// stores
  messages 5200 through 5299 and the file ``index'' which contains the
  index for those messages.

  The message index can be retrieved with the -index command (see ezmlm-
  get(1)). You can also retrieve a range of messages, a specific thread,
  or generate a message digest (see ezmlm-get(1)). Each of these
  commands can be disabled or restricted as desired by the list owner.

  The ezmlm-idx(1) can be used at any time to either reconstruct an
  existing index or create one an index for an existing message archive.
  without one.

  A ezmlm thread is just a message number-ordered set of messages with
  identical ``normalized'' subject entries. This is a very reliable
  method for threading messages. It does not rely on any variably
  present ``In-Reply-To:'' or ``References:'' headers. If the subject
  changes, the continuation becomes a separate thread very close to the
  original thread in a digest. ezmlm uses this mechanism to return
  message sets threaded and with a thread and author index, unless
  specifically told not to do so with the ``n'' format specifier.
  Naturally, lists set up without a message index (using the ezmlm-make
  ``-I'' switch) do not maintain thread information.


  44..2233..  HHooww ddiiggeessttss wwoorrkk..

  A ``digest'' is just an ordered collection of messages from a list,
  usually sent out regularly depending on the time and traffic volume
  since the last digest. Digest subscribers thus can read messages as
  ``threads'' once daily, rather than receiving a constant trickle of
  messages.

  As a major change in ezmlm-idx-0.30, the digest is no longer a totally
  separate ezmlm-list, but a part of the main list. This has security
  advantages, makes setup and administration easier, saves space, and
  allows a consistent way for subscribers of both ``list'' and ``list-
  digest'' to retrieve missed messages from a single archive.

  The digest of the list ``list'' is always called ``list-digest''. To
  set up a list with a digest, simply use the ezmlm-make(1) ``-d''
  switch. You subscribe to and unsubscribe from a digest the same way as
  for the main list, except that the request is sent to e.g. list-
  digest-subscribe@host rather than to list-subscribe@host.

  Any option such as remote admin or subscription moderation that is
  active for the list applies also to the digest list. Any restrictions
  in posts or archive retrieval set up for the list, automatically
  accept both subscribers of the main list and of the digest list.

  The changes in ezmlm-idx>=0.30 allow all programs to service both list
  and list-digest functions.  All digest-specific files are stored in
  DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt//.  Digest list subscriber addresses in
  DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss// and digest list bounce information in
  DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt//bboouunnccee//. Text files are shared between list and digest. To
  get the local part of the list or list-digest name in a context
  sensitive manner, use ``<#l#>'' (lower case ``L'') in the text file.


  In order to generate digest, the list needs to be archived and indexed
  (both default).  You can retrieve sets of messages from the message
  archive. Such sets are always returned to the SENDER of the request.
  ``Digests'' are a special form of such a set/request. First, there are
  no restrictions on the number of messages that can be in a digest
  (which is balanced by the requirement for a ``digest code'' that needs
  to be specified in order to create a digest based on a mailed
  request).  Second, special files (DDIIRR//ddiiggiissssuuee and DDIIRR//ddiiggnnuumm) keep
  track of the digest issue and the message number, amount, and time
  when the last digest was created.  Thus, the system is adapted to make
  it easy to create the regular collections of messages commonly
  referred to as ``digests''.

  Digest can be generated in several different ways:

     CCoommmmaanndd lliinnee
        ezmlm-get can be invoked on the command line, or via a script
        from e.g.  crond(8):


                  % ezmlm-get DIR




     If for some reason the digest should be disseminated via a separate
     list, the digest can be redirected to a ``target address'' with the
     ezmlm-get(1) ``-t'' switch. This may be useful if a non-standard
     digest list name is required. In this case, the list disseminating
     the digest must be set up as a sublist of the main list (see ``How
     sublists work'').


     ffrroomm DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr
        This is the default and does not require and additional setup.
        It works well with most lists. The only possible advantage is
        for very low traffic lists and for lists where it is important
        that a digest be sent out at a specific time (as DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr
        digests are triggered only when messages are received).

        In DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr, ezmlm-get(1) needs to be combined with ezmlm-
        tstdig(1) so that digests are generated only if certain criteria
        are met (in this case, more than 30 messages, 64 kbytes of
        message body or 48 hours since the latest digest). Add these
        lines after the ezmlm-send line in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr:


                  |/usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-tstdig -t48 -m30 -k64 DIR || exit 99
                  |/usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-get diglist@host DIR || exit 0




     To set this up automatically when you create the list:


                  % ezmlm-make -d DIR dot local host [code]




     Again, the ezmlm-get(1) ``-t'' switch can be used for non-standard
     arrangements to redirect the digest.  The ezmlm-make(1) ``-4''
     switch can be used to specify alternative ezmlm-tstdig(1) parame-
     ters.

     ffrroomm DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr
        This is useful only if you want digests at specific times, and
        you do not have access to crond(8) on the list host.  ezmlm-
        get(1) is in it's normal place in DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr before ezmlm-
        manage(1), but a digest code is specified in the ezmlm-get(1)
        command line. To trigger digests requires a regular trigger
        messages generated from e.g. crond(8) (see below), but this can
        be done from _any_ host, not only the list host.  ezmlm-make(1)
        sets up ezmlm-get(1) this way if a digest ``code'' is given as
        the 5th ezmlm-make(1) command line argument. However, you need
        to set up the trigger messages separately (see below):


                  % ezmlm-make DIR dot local host code




     To also test for message volume with this setup, generate trigger
     messages with the granularity you'd like, and add a ezmlm-tstdig(1)
     line to DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr. E.g., use a trigger message every 3 hours and
     the following ezmlm-tstdig(1) line before ezmlm-get(1):


                  |/usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-tstdig -t24 -m30 -k64 DIR || exit 99




     In general, a cron-triggered digest is preferred for very large
     lists and for lists with very low traffic.  Again, the ezmlm-get(1)
     ``-t'' switch can be used for non-standard arrangements to redirect
     the digest.  For most lists, the digesting from DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr works
     very well, and does not require any extra setup work.

     CCoommbbiinnaattiioonn sseettuuppss
        The default setup in the ezmlmrc(5) file included in the
        distribution is the DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr triggered setup described above.
        If you in addition use ezmlm-cron(1) or crond(8) directly to
        generate trigger messages to list-dig.code@host, you can get
        regular digests (via the trigger messages and DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr), with
        extra digest sent when traffic is unusually high (via the ezmlm-
        tstdig/ezmlm-get limits set in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr).  This works best
        when the time argument on the ezmlm-tstdig(1) command line is
        the same as the trigger message interval, and the other ezmlm-
        tstdig(1) parameters are set so that they are only rarely
        exceeded within the normal digest interval.

  If the list is set up with ezmlm-make -i, ezmlm-archive(1) will be
  invoked from DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr. This program creates indices for threads,
  subjects, and authors under DDIIRR//aarrcchhiivvee from the iinnddeexx files.  ezmlm-

  different lists via the //eettcc//eezzmmllmm//eezzccggiirrcc file. ezmlm-cgi(1) presents
  and used the index created by ezmlm-archive(1) and converts these and
  the messages to html on-the-fly. To be as efficient as possible,
  ezmlm-cgi(1) outputs only basic html. However, style sheets are
  supported and can be used to customize formatting without modification
  of ezmlm-cgi(1).  Extra buttons can be added via the config file. See

  ezmlm-tstdig(1) looks at DDIIRR//nnuumm and DDIIRR//ddiiggnnuumm to determine how many
  messages and how much traffic (in terms of bytes of message body) has
  arrived to the list since the latest digest. It also determines how
  much time has passed since the last digest was generated. If any of
  the criteria specified by command line switches exists, ezmlm-
  tstdig(1) exits 0, causing the invocation of the next line in the
  .qmail file. If not, ezmlm-tstdig(1) exits 99 causing qmail to skip
  the rest of the .qmail file. ezmlm-tstdig(1) looks at LOCAL to
  determine if it is invoked in the command line, in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr, or in
  DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr. In the latter two cases, ezmlm-tstdig(1) verifies that
  the list local address is correct. If invoked in DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr, ezmlm-
  tstdig(1) exits 0 for all action requests except list-dig, so that is
  does not interfere with the normal functions of ezmlm-get(1) and
  ezmlm-manage(1). ezmlm-tstdig(1) uses DDIIRR//ttssttddiigg as a flag to avoid
  problems caused by starting the program when another copy is already
  running.

  ezmlm-make(1) automatically configures ezmlm-tstdig(1) with the
  parameters ``-t48 -m30 -k64'', which can be overridden with the ``-3''
  switch.


  44..2266..  HHooww ssuubblliissttss wwoorrkk..

  ezmlm uses the concept of sublists.  Sublists are regular ezmlm lists,
  except that they only accept messages from their parent list, which is
  placed in the file DDIIRR//ssuubblliisstt.

  sublists are used to split the load of a large mailing list among
  several hosts. All you need to do to set up a local sublist of e.g.
  the qmail@list.cr.yp.to list is to create a ezmlm list, and put
  ``qmail@list.cr.yp.to'' into DDIIRR//ssuubblliisstt of you list, and subscribe
  the sublist to the main qmail list. Now anyone can subscribe to your
  local list which handles its own bounces, subscribe requests, etc.
  The load on the main list is only the single message to your local
  list.

  Sublists will not add their own mailing list header and they will not
  add a subject prefix. Normally, sublists will use their own message
  number, rather than that used by the main list.  With ezmlm-idx>=0.23,
  sublists that are not archived and not indexed, will instead use the
  main list message number. This way, bounce messages from the sublist
  can refer the subscriber to the main list archive. This is not done
  for indexed/archived sublists for security reasons (an attacker could
  overwrite messages in the sublist archive).

  With ezmlm-idx>=0.31, there is support for using ezmlm as a sublist of
  a mailing list run by another mailing list manager. To set this up,
  set up a normal ezmlm sublist, then edit DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr so that the _e_z_m_l_m_-
  _s_e_n_d line contains the command line option ``--hh _X_-_L_i_s_t_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r_-
  _V_e_r_s_i_o_n_:'' (before DDIIRR). As the header text, you need to use a header
  that the main list manager adds to messages. Now your sublist will
  accept only messages from the main list requiring that they come from
  that list _a_n_d contain the header specified.

  ezmlm-idx>=0.313 also has added protection against the malicious
  subscription of the ezmlm list to mailing lists run by other list
  managers. If the ezmlm-reject(1) line in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr has ``-h'' and
  ``DDIIRR'' on it, ezmlm-reject(1) will read DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerrrreejjeecctt and reject
  messages that have any header specified in that file. See the ezmlm-
  reject(1) man page for suitable headers.

  Often you create a local sublist of a list that you do not control.
  Local users know to subscribe to your local list. However,
  occasionally, you want to run your own list as a main list and a
  series of sublists per geographic site, or split onto several hosts if
  the list is too large to be handled by a single computer. You may also
  want to split the load of a ``well known'' list host that is getting
  overwhelmed with traffic. ezmlm supports sublists, but here the fact
  that the user has to interact with the correct sublist is a problem.
  What if the user doesn't remember which sublist s/he is subscribed to?
  What if you change the name of a sublist host or move a sublist to a
  different host?

  ezmlm-idx&-0.32 adds ezmlm-split(1), which allows sublisting
  transparent to the user. This program is invoked before ezmlm-
  manage(1) in DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr. If it detects a subscribe or unsubscribe
  command, it will forward the command to the appropriate sublist based
  on a ``split file'' DDIIRR//sspplliitt. This file contains entries, one per
  line, of the format:


               domain:lo:hi:sublistname@sublisthost
               edu:::othersub@otherhost
               :1:26:third@thirdhost




  For each address, a hash in the range 0-52 is calculated. The
  ``domain'' is the last two parts of the host name, reversed. Thus, for
  id.wustl.edu it would be ``edu.wustl''. The domain is considered to
  match if the characters in the split file match. It is advisable to
  use only the last part of the domain for compatibility with the SQL
  version version  (see section ``ezmlm support for SQL datbases'').

  Thus, any address *@*.domain with a hash between ``lo'' and ``hi''
  inclusive would match the first line and be forwarded to
  sublistname@sublisthost.  *@*.edu (independent of hash) would match
  the second line and be forwarded to othersub@otherhost. Of remaining
  requests, a request for any target address with a hash between 1 and
  26 would be forwarded to the sublist third@thirdhost. Remaining
  requests would be passed on to the local list.

  The domain is useful for ``geographic'' splitting, and the hash for
  load splitting (within a domain). The user interacts only with the
  main list, and does not need to know from which sublist s/he is
  serviced.

  ezmlm-idx sublists use the message number of the main list message if
  they are not indexed. This allows sublists to in bounce messages refer
  the subscriber to the main list archive. Use ezmlm-make(1) in
  conjunction with ezmlmsubrc(5) to set up the sublists. See man pages
  for further details.

  Since the addresses are stored locally, the system is very fast and
  robust, but it is difficult to add new sublists. ezmlm-split(1) -D
  supports parsing addresses on stdin and splitting them to stdout (see
  man page). Thus, if you divide the domain of some sublist(s) onto a
  net set of sublists, you can use ezmlm-list(1) to collect the
  addresses, ezmlm-split -D with the new split file to split them, then
  after clearing the local subscriber databases use ezmlm-sub(1) to add
  the correct addresses to each new sublist.  The section on SQL support
  describes an alternative way of managing sublists (see section ``ezmlm
  support for SQL datbases'').

  Rfc2142 (standards track) says that for each mailing list list@host,
  there MUST be an administrative address list-request@host. This is not
  the default for ezmlm, but can be added with ezmlm-make(1) ``-q'',
  which adds a ezmlm-request(1) line before the ezmlm-manage(1) line in
  DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr. This address is used to manage commands in the
  ``Subject:'' line, by translating them into appropriate ezmlm command
  messages.

  When migrating from other mailing list managers which use this method
  to issue list commands, configuring ezmlm to respond to such commands
  may be useful. In addition, some software manufacturers sell MUAs and
  mail gateways that are unable to correctly transport rfc822-compliant
  Internet mail with certain characters in the local part of the
  address.

  ezmlm-request(1) services the list-request@host address per rfc2142
  (standards track). It is usually invoked in DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr before ezmlm-
  get(1) and ezmlm-manage(1). It ignores all requests that are not for
  the list-request address. For requests to the list-request@host
  address, ezmlm-request(1) parses the ``Subject:'' line. If a ezmlm
  command address starting with the contents of DDIIRR//oouuttllooccaall (e.g. list-
  get45) is on the command line, ezmlm-request(1) generates the
  corresponding full ezmlm request message. If the subject does not
  start with the contents of DDIIRR//oouuttllooccaall, ezmlm-request(1) prefixes the
  line with the contents of DDIIRR//oouuttllooccaall, thereby building a complete
  ezmlm command. If a host name is specified, it must match the contents
  of DDIIRR//oouutthhoosstt, i.e. ezmlm-request(1) in this function will only
  generate command messages for the local list.

  Thus, a subject of ``subscribe'' to list-request@host will be auto-
  magically rewritten as a message to list-subscribe-
  userlocal=userhost@host.  Similarly, any ezmlm command or ``Reply-
  To:'' address can be pasted into the subject field and sent to list-
  request@host.  ezmlm-request(1) does not validate the command name,
  but invalid commands result in a ``help'' message in reply via ezmlm-
  manage(1). This allows ezmlm-request(1) to also service custom
  commands, like list-faq@host that you may have created for your list.

  If the ``Subject:'' is empty or does not start with a letter, ezmlm-
  request(1) will attempt to interpret the first message body line that
  starts with a letter in the first position.

  When ezmlm-request(1) has successfully processed a ''request''
  command, it exits 99 to skip the rest of DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr.

  To set up a list to include ezmlm-request processing, use the ezmlm-
  make(1) ``-q'' switch. The default is to not do this.

  ezmlm-idx>=0.23 allows alternate names for all user commands. This can
  be used to e.g. make a message to list-remove@host to result in an
  ``unsubscribe'' action. This may help migration from other mailing
  list managers and in non-English environments. The use of aliases
  allows ezmlm to respond to new command names, while always responding
  correctly to the standard commands. If ezmlm-request(1) is used it
  will automatically be able to deal with any commands you set up for
  the list, within ezmlm or as separate programs.  See ``Multiple
  language support'' on how to set up command aliases.

  The qmail/ezmlm mechanism makes it very easy to add your own commands.
  You can add them to DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr, but this requires great care in terms
  of ordering and exit codes. Easier is to set them up separately with a
  ..qqmmaaiill--lliisstt--ccoommmmaanndd file.

  Let's assume you want to allow anyone to determine how many
  subscribers are subscribed to your list with the command list-
  count@host.  Just create a program to do the work:


               #!/bin/sh
               DTLINE='Delivered-To: list-count@host processor'
               grep "$DTLINE" > /dev/null &&
                       { echo "This message is looping"; exit 100; }
               {
                 echo "$DTLINE"
                 cat <<EOF
                 From: list-help@host
                 To: $SENDER
                 Subject: list@host subscriber count

                 Current number of subscribers:
                 EOF
                 ezmlm-list ~/DIR | wc -l
               } | /var/qmail/qmail-inject -f list-return- "$SENDER"
               exit 0




  Then, create DDIIRR//ccoouunntt containing ``|/path/program'' and then do ``ln
  -sf DIR/count ~/.qmail-list-count''. Now, the command will pass the
  message to ``program''. The first thing ``program'' looks for is its
  delivered-to line to detect looping. If not found, it goes on to print
  this header, followed by some minimal text and the subscriber number.
  This can of course be made prettier with ezmlm-list error checking,
  and maybe in perl, but shows how easy it is to extend ezmlm. All
  thanks to the DJB/qmail delivery mechanism.

  A user with shell access can always manipulate subscriber lists with
  ezmlm-sub(1), ezmlm-unsub(1), and ezmlm-list(1) for the lists s/he
  owns.

  Sometimes a remote administrator requires a list of subscriber E-mail
  addresses. At the same time, the list should be kept out of the hands
  of spammers and all unauthorized entities. By default, ezmlm does not
  allow remote subscriber list retrieval.  You can enable the ``-list''
  command for remote retrieval of a subscriber list by using the ezmlm-
  make(1) ``-l'' switch or by adding the ``-l'' switch to the ezmlm-
  manage(1) line in DIR/manager. With this switch, ezmlm will permit
  retrieval of a subscriber list, but only to remote administrators.
  Subscribers cannot get the list membership, and any outsider would
  have to be able to read a remote administrator's mail to get the list.

  The list returned is unsorted for efficiency reasons. You can easily
  sort it or use your mail reader to find a specific entry. The number
  of subscribers is shown at the bottom of the list. To get the number
  of subscribers from the command line, use:
               % ezmlm-list DIR | wc -l

  The same conditions that enable remote administrators to retrieve a
  subscriber list (see ``'') also enable the remote admin to retrieve
  the subscription log, i.e. the log of changes made to the subscriber
  list. The command is list-log@host. The entries are of the form ``date
  timestamp dir event address comment''. ``dir'' is ``+'' for addition
  of an address, ``-'' for removal, ``event'' is empty for normal
  (un)subscribe ``manual'' for changes made with ezmlm-(un)sub, and
  ``probe'' for removals via bounce handling. ``address'' is the
  subscription address, and ``comment'' is empty or the subscribers
  ``From:'' line. The log can be used to look at recent
  additions/removals and to try to track down a subscriber address from
  e.g. the name on the ``From:'' line. The log is written on a best-
  effort basis. In contrast to the subscriber database, entries in the
  log may be lost at a system crash.

  The remote administrator can do a case-insensitive search through the
  log with the command list-log.xxx@host, where ``xxx'' is any sequence
  of letters/numbers that must occur on a line in order for that line to
  be included in the reply. A ``_'' is a wild card and should be used
  for special characters as well. Thus, to search for any entry with a
  host name of host* mail list-log._host and to find entries for ``Keith
  John...'' etc, use list-log.keith_john.

  For SQL-enabled lists, this command searches the ``list_slog'' table.

  If a list is set up with the ezmlm-make(1) ``-n'' switch, or if the
  ``-e'' switch is added to the ezmlm-manage(1) line in DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr,
  ezmlm allows remote administrators to edit the text files that make up
  most of the ezmlm responses.  Of course, this will work only if remote
  administration is enabled for the list. Replies are sent only if the
  target address is a remote administrator.  Thus, ezmlm does not rely
  on SENDER (easily forged) but on the notion that only the recipient
  receives the message.  This is a reasonable assumption for remote
  administrators that receive mail on the local system.

  With this switch, ezmlm replies to the -edit command with a list of
  the files in DDIIRR//tteexxtt//.  Only files where editing seems reasonable are
  included in the list. The remote administrator can edit any file in
  DDIIRR//tteexxtt// by sending e-mail containing the new text to -edit.file
  where ``file'' is the name of the file replaced (edited). The file
  must exist and the name consist of only lower case letters and '-'.
  Any '-' (hyphen) must be substituted by a '_' (underscore). For remote
  administrator convenience, the substitution has been made in the list
  of files sent in reply to the -edit command.

  In reply to this command, ezmlm sends a message with the file and
  editing instructions. A ``cookie'' based on the date, file name, and
  contents of the file is added to the ``Reply-To:'' address. The cookie
  becomes invalid as soon as the file has been changed, or after 27
  hours, whichever is shorter.  Also, the cookie cannot be used to edit
  any other file, even if the other file has exactly the same contents.
  If you sent an edit request, and decide not to edit the file, you can
  simply delete the message.

  To apply standard changes to all your text files it is easier to edit
  ~~//..eezzmmllmmrrcc. To reset the list's text files back to their default
  contents (as specified by eezzmmllmmrrcc((55))), use the ezmlm-make(1) ``-ee''
  switch together with any other switches used to set up the list, or
  the ``-++'' switch and any switches that you whish to change from the
  current configuration.

  First of all, it is against a number of RFCs to modify the
  ``Subject:'' header of messages. However, it is frequently requested
  by users who have seen it on other list managers. Second, it is many
  times worse to have a prefix that changes from message to message,
  such as a prefix with the message number.  However, a number of lists,
  especially in Japan, use this feature and in its absence these lists
  might be unable to take advantage of ezmlm. Thus, while we recommend
  against using a prefix, ezmlm-idx supports it.

  To add a subject prefix, just put the text into DDIIRR//pprreeffiixx. The only
  format that makes any sense is ``list:'' or ``(list)'' or such.

  The message number prefix is activated by putting e.g. ``(list-#)''
  into DDIIRR//pprreeffiixx. ``#'' is replaced by the message number. ezmlm
  refuses to make more drastic changes in the subject of a message. As a
  consequence, the message number prefix is added only when the subject
  does not already contain a prefix. Thus, replies will have the message
  number of the original message. Doing anything else and still
  supporting rfc2047-encoded subjects in the archive threading (much
  more important) would require decoding the subject, removing/editing
  the prefix, and re-encoding the subject. This is far too invasive.

  The entire thread can always be retrieved by sending a message to
  list-thread-x where ``x'' is the message number in the prefix of any
  message in the thread.

  Ezmlm messages are sent with an envelope sender (``Return-Path'') that
  directs bounces to DDIIRR//bboouunncceerr and also via ``VERP'' contain
  information about the intended recipient. Thus, programs run from
  DDIIRR//bboouunncceerr know the subscriber for whom the message bounced. ezmlm-
  weed(1) is used to weed out delivery delay notification and other
  junk.  For others ezmlm-return(1) decides if the address is a
  subscriber.  If so, it saves the first bounce message and a list of
  bounced-message numbers. ezmlm-warn(1) executed from e.g. DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr
  goes through these bounce files. If it finds any that are older than
  1,000,000 seconds (about 11.6 days) it sends a warning message to the
  subscriber. If this warning message bounces, ezmlm-return(1) sets up a
  "warning flag" for the subscriber. If ezmlm-warn(1) finds a warning
  flag older than 11.6 days, it sends a "probe" to the subscriber.  If
  ezmlm-return(1) receives a bounced probe, the subscriber is
  automatically unsubscribed.

  The ezmlm-warn(1) ``-t'' switch can be used to change the time-out (in
  days).  The ezmlm-warn(1) ``-d'' switch causes processing of ``list-
  digest'' bounces rather than ``list'' bounces. ezmlm-weed(1) and
  ezmlm-return(1) can handle bounces for either list.

  ezmlm-warn(1) also removes any files in the bounce directory that are
  older than 3 times the bounce time-out.

  ezmlm-warn(1) is normally run from DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr. This can take quite a
  lot of resources, if there are a large number of bouncing addresses
  (>>1000) on a busy list, since by default all bounces are stored in a
  single directory and ezmlm-warn(1) examines all of them with each
  invocation.  ezmlm-idx->=0.32 changes bounce handling to improve
  performance for large lists. Bounces are stored in subdirectories of
  DDIIRR//bboouunnccee//dd//, one per 10,000 seconds. The corresponding address
  hashes are stored in 16 subdirectories of DDIIRR//bboouunnccee//hh//. Instead of
  looking at all bounces, ezmlm-warn(1) processes only the bounces in
  DDIIRR//bboouunnccee//dd// subdirectories that are ``due''. In addition, ezmlm-
  warn(1) uses DDIIRR//bboouunnccee//llaassttdd as a simple lockout, to assure that it
  will do work only at most once every 5.5 hours. (Times are scaled to
  the ezmlm-warn(1) ``-t'' argument if used.)  Together, these changes
  assure that bounce handling will scale well in the default
  configuration, even for very large lists.

  Sometimes, it is desirable to have a host- or user-wide address that
  can list available mailing lists.

  ezmlm-request(1) can be used to set up a global address, such as
  ezmlm@host which allows the user to see and interact with a number of
  different mailing lists. This is especially useful when your users are
  used to other mailing list managers, such as ``majordomo'' or
  ``listproc''. ezmlm-request(1) is set up to answer requests to the
  address (see ``How to set up a global list address like majordomo@host
  or listserv@host'').  There, it interprets the first line of the
  message body as a command. It will reply directly to ``lists'' and
  ``which'' commands. All other commands will be used to construct
  messages to the respective lists. Where other mailing list managers
  use synonyms of ezmlm commands, ezmlm-request(1) recognizes these and
  translates them to the corresponding ezmlm commands.  ezmlm-request(1)
  will build commands also of unrecognized commands. Thus, if you create
  new commands for a list, ezmlm-request(1) will automatically support
  them.

  If the user does not specify the complete list address, ezmlm-
  request(1) will attempt to complete the name. See the ezmlm-reject(1)
  man page for more info.

  If you are a user and have crond(8) access, if you do not need to get
  digests at specific times, or if you are a system administrator
  setting up lists, there is no reason for you to use ezmlm-cron(1). If
  you are a system administrator not allowing users crond(8) access or a
  user that needs digests at specific times, but without crond(8)
  access, read on.

  ezmlm-cron(1) is a very restrictive interface to crond(8).  ezmlm-
  cron(1) can be used to create digest trigger messages. If a list is
  set up with a digest code (see ezmlm-make(1) and ezmlm-get(1)) ezmlm
  will generate a digest from the list joe-sos@host sent to to
  subscribers of joe-sos-digest@dighost when receiving a message to joe-
  sos-dig-code@host where ``code'' is the digest code. ezmlm-cron(1) can
  be used to generate such messages at regular intervals.  The file
  eezzccrroonnrrcc is set up by the sysadmin and controls what trigger messages
  specific users may set up via ezmlm-cron(1).

  Usually, the ezcronrc of that use will have an entry like
  ``user:user-:host:10'' allowing ``user'' to create trigger messages
  for up to 10 lists with names starting with ``user-'' and on the host
  ``host''.

  To list the ezcronrc line controlling your use of ezmlm-cron(1):


               % ezmlm-cron -c




  To list all entries that you've created:


               % ezmlm-cron -l




  To add an entry to trigger digests from list@host every morning at
  0230:


               % ezmlm-cron -t 02:30 -i24 list@host code




  A new entry for the same list overwrites an old entry.

  To delete the entry above:


               % ezmlm-cron -d list@host




  or use ezmlm-cron to trigger messages at a different time:


               % ezmlm-cron -t 16:16 -i24 list@host code

  ezmlm lists allow almost infinite customization. The component build,
  together with the qmail delivery mechanism makes it possible to create
  any variant of list function imaginable. However, this complexity
  makes it somewhat daunting to the average user wanting to set up a
  mailing list. ezmlm-make(1) allows automated list setup, while
  permitting a large amount of configurability.

  At first glance, ezmlm-make(1) has many complicated options. However,
  these can be applied iteratively through the ezmlm-make(1) edit
  mechanism. Also, they are intended to be relatively complete so that
  execution of ezmlm-make(1) by e.g. a GUI can be used to safely set up
  and edit any list.

  ezmlm-make(1) reads its command line arguments and switches, then
  creates the list directory. If the ``-e'' edit or ``-+'' sticky edit
  switches are not specified, ezmlm-make(1) will fail if the directory
  already exists. The directory argument must be an absolute path
  starting with a slash. The dot-qmail file argument, if specified, must
  also be absolute.

  ezmlm-make(1) next reads ezmlmrc(5) located in the //eettcc// directory
  with a default install. If not found, the file in the ezmlm binary
  directory will be used. The second ezmlm-make command line argument
  specify the root name of the .qmail files. If the ezmlm-make(1) ``-c''
  switch is used, ezmlm-make(1) will look in that directory for a
  ..eezzmmllmmrrcc file and use it instead. If this file does not exist, ezmlm-
  make(1) will print a warning and use the previously discussed
  ezmlmrc(5) files in the same order.  You can also use ``-C
  _e_z_m_l_m_r_c_._a_l_t'' to use _e_z_m_l_m_r_c_._a_l_t as the ezmlmrc(5) file. Again, ezmlm-
  make(1) will fall back to the others with a warning, if the specified
  ezmlmrc(5) file is not found.

  When not run in ``-e edit'' or ``-+'' sticky edit modes, ezmlm-make(1)
  first creates the list directory.  It also as the last step of its
  action creates DDIIRR//kkeeyy containing the key used for cookie generation.

  The ezmlmrc(5) file consists of a number of file names relative to the
  list directory, followed by conditional flags (see ezmlm-make(1) and
  ezmlmrc(5) for details). If all the conditional flags (controlled by
  the corresponding command line switches) are true, the lines that
  follow are entered into the named file. There are also tags to erase
  files.  Tags in the format <#X#> (where ``X'' is any number, except
  ``1'' and ``2'') are replaced by the corresponding ezmlm-make(1)
  switch argument. The ezmlm-make(1) command line arguments and the
  ezmlm binary path can be similarly substituted into the text. Thus,
  ezmlmrc(5) controls (within reason) the entire operation of ezmlm-
  make(1). ezmlmrc(5) is also set up so that no messages or file
  containing list state information are lost. Therefore, ezmlm-make(1)
  can be used to safely edit existing lists. The only caveat is that the
  list state is undefined while editing is in progress. Thus, it is
  advisable to prevent mail delivery by setting the ``sticky'' bit on
  the user's home directory while editing lists.

  ezmlm-make(1) will create the file DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg. This files saves all
  the flags that were set at the last execution of ezmlm-make, as well
  as all the switch and command line arguments. When editing a list,
  only ``DIR'' and the non-default letter switches need to be specified.
  Other command line arguments and the ``digit switch'' arguments are
  read from DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg.  To remove a digit switch, simply use it with
  two single quotes as the argument.

  You can also easily determine how a list was set up by looking at
  DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg.

  _N_o_t_e_: DDIIRR//tteexxtt// files will be created but not overwritten when using
  the ``-e'' or ``-+'' edit switches. This is to preserve manual
  customizations. To overwrite these and reset the files to the content
  specified by eezzmmllmmrrcc, use ``-ee'' or ``-++''.

  _N_o_t_e_: As of ezmlm-idx-0.40 the ezmlm-make(1) ``-c'' and ``-C file''
  switches are sticky when using ``-+'' or ``-++'', so you do not need
  to specify them. This feature is disabled if ezmlm-make(1) is run as
  root.

  Rather than restrict you to a single E-mail address (user@host), qmail
  in the default setup gives you control over an infinite number of
  addresses user-*@host. Of course, you (normally) have no way of
  controlling elsewhere@host since that could lead to overlap between
  users' ``e-mail address space''. As a consequence, all you mailing
  lists have to be named user-xx@host where ``user'' is your user name
  and ``xx'' is anything. You cannot create e.g. mylist@host, only user-
  mylist@host. To create the list user-list@host do:


               % ezmlm-make ~/list ~/.qmail-list user-list host




  Notice that ``user'' is nnoott part of the ..qqmmaaiill file name.

  There are two way to create lists with names not starting with your
  user name: First, qmail can be set up so that you control a virtual
  domain (see below).  Second, the system administrator can set up lists
  with arbitrary names within the ~~aalliiaass// directory.

  If you use qmail>=1.02 and ezmlm-idx>=0.32, lists under virtual
  domains work just like other lists and require no adjustments. You can
  choose any local name for the list and the ezmlm-make(1) argument
  ``local'' is that name; ``host'' is the name of the virtual domain.

  All non-default switches, ezmlm-issubn(1) setups, etc, can be made
  standard for new lists by customizing the ezmlm-make(1) configuration
  file named ``eezzmmllmmrrcc''.  A default eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) is installed in the
  ezmlm binary directory. If installed, a system-wide customized ezmlmrc
  file in //eettcc//eezzmmllmmrrcc (or symlinked from there) overrides this.
  Installing a ~~//..eezzmmllmmrrcc file in a user ddoottddiirr and using the ezmlm-
  make(1) ``-c'' switch allows further per user customization (see
  ``Customizing ezmlm-make operation'').

  The main advantages are that you are using an address database system
  that can easily be accessed from any number of other programs via
  ODBC, perl, java, PHP, ... You can easily hook up ezmlm with your
  customer database, etc.  ezmlm programs compiled with SQL support (and
  when available also those compiled with support for other SQL servers)
  are entirely backwards compatible. You can mix SQL dbs with normal
  ezmlm dbs, and convert lists between them.

  The main disadvantages of the SQL version are that you need to be
  familiar with the SQL server, the binaries are quite a bit larger, and
  you are trusting your addresses to a large database program, rather
  than a small and easily audited set of ezmlm programs. Also, the SQL
  server becomes a single point of failure.

  Ezmlm with SQL support continues to rely on qmail stability. If
  connection fails, ezmlm aborts with a temporary error causing
  redelivery at a later time point.

  The basic philosophy is that the database can be on any host (if you
  use SENDER restrictions, connectivity to the main host is more
  important than to the sublists), and you choose the database and
  ``table root'' names. The default database is ``ezmlm'' and the
  default table root is ``list''. Each list has a separate table root.
  Any number of lists can share a database.

  The main list address table is named with the table root only, others
  have that name with various suffixes. In the following ``list'' is
  used as the table root.

  For each of the above tables, there is a ``*_slog'' table that
  contains one row per transaction against the corresponding address
  table. The entries contain a time stamp, the subscription address; a
  direction indicator (``-'' for removals, ``+'' for additions); a type
  indicator (blank for ezmlm-manage, ``m'' for ``manual'', ``p'' for
  ``probe, i.e. bounce handling; and the subscriber ``From:'' line
  contents (only additions and only when made by ezmlm-manage or by
  ``ezmlm-sub(1) -n'').

  For both the list and the digest list, there are a pair of tables that
  log messages:


     lliisstt__ccooookkiiee
        The main list stores the message number and a pseudo-random
        cookie in this table when it processes the message. The cookie
        is derived from the secret DDIIRR//kkeeyy, the message sender and the
        message number. Thus, it is non-repeating and virtually
        impossible to guess beforehand. Sublists will check that the
        cookie sent with the message is the same as the one received
        with the message.

        The digest list is created similarly, except that it is ezmlm-
        get(1) that originates the message and creates the cookie.  This
        is done in ``list_digest_cookie''.


     lliisstt__mmlloogg
        Both the main list and the sublists make entries in this table.
        Each entry consists of a time stamp, a message number, a list
        number, and a code. The code is 0 for message arrival, 1 for
        ``finished processing'', 2 for ``receipt received'' and -1 for
        bounce. The lists will refuse to process messages that do not
        have the correct cookie, or if the message already has an entry
        with a code of greater than 0. To inject a message at the
        sublist, an attacker would have to inject a message with the
        correct code before the list has processed the ``real'' message,
        or subvert the SQL server. In practice, this is very hard to do,
        unless the attacker has broken security at the database server
        or a sublist. This authentication mechanism is intended to make
        it safe to sublist moderated lists. It also blocks any message
        duplication between main list and sublist from being propagated
        to the subscribers.

        The codes 2 for ``receipt received'' and -1 for bounce are
        entered by ezmlm-receipt(1) at the main list. This program is
        configured instead of ezmlm-return(1) if the main list was set
        up with ``ezmlm-make -w6''.  ezmlm-receipt(1) checks the cookie
        of messages addresses to mainlocal-return-receipt@mainhost and
        if correct enters the ``receipt received'' code. This address is
        normally in the subscriber database with a hash of 98, so that
        each list sends a message to the address _a_f_t_e_r all subscriber
        addresses.

        Bounces of sublist messages should not lead to removal of the
        sublist from the database. ezmlm-receipt(1) will instead log the
        bounce to the ``list_mlog'' table. It will also store up to 50
        bounces in the bounce directory. This helps error detection and
        diagnosis. After the first 50 bounces, no more bounces are
        stored, until you manually remove the old ones. This is to
        prevent filling up your hard disk in case a configuration error
        causes a deluge of bounces.

        The digest list is treated in the same manner. Here, the tables
        is ``list_digest_mlog'' and the feedback address is mainlocal-
        digest-return-receipt@mainhost.

  To use SQL database support, you have to compile the programs with SQL
  support. Currently, only MySQL support is available. See IINNSSTTAALLLL..iiddxx
  in the package on how to do this.

  The programs with SQL support will work exactly like the normal
  programs for standard lists. However, if the file ssqqll exists in the
  basedir, it turns on the SQL mode and it is expected to contain SQL
  server connect info in the format

       ``host:port:user:password:database:table''


  Here, ``Host'' is the SQL database server host, ``port'' can be left
  blank to use the default port, ``user'' and  ``password'' are connec-
  tion credentials for a user you need to define and grant access to the
  database. ``Table'' is the name of the address table (``list'' in the
  examples above and ``list_digest'' for the corresponding digest list).
  For list clusters, ``:sublist'' is suffixed to this info and it is the
  name/address of the sublist.

  For each address database, you also need to create the address table
  as well as the ``*_slog'' subscription log table. In addition, you
  should create a ``*_cookie'' and ``*_mlog'' table for message logging.
  This is all it takes to start using an SQL database.

  Two programs are supplied in the distribution to make it easier to
  create the database user and tables. Also, ezmlm-make(1) has support
  for setting up SQL-enabled lists.


     CCrreeaattiinngg tthhee ttaabblleess
        ezmlm-mktab(1) will create the necessary tables:


                  % ezmlm-mktab -d table




     Pipe this into the SQL client with the appropriate administrator
     credentials needed to create tables (see MySQL documentation, e.g.
     <http://www.tcx.se/>).

     For most lists, the only addresses that are stored in the SQL
     database are the subscribers of list and digest, and the ``allow''
     aliases. It is NOT normally advisable to store moderator addresses
     there, since they are needed only at the main list and secrecy is
     more important. ``Deny'' addresses are few and again only needed at
     the main list. ``Allow'' are put in the SQL database when using the
     default ezmlmrc file only to make all relevant addresses
     manipulatable via the SQL server. The other tables are created, in
     case they are  wanted (the cost for having them as empty table is
     zero). The basedir/sql file is the decision point. If it exists, an
     SQL table is used; if not a local ezmlm db is used.

        Create a user that has full access to the database from the list

        ezmlm-make(1) supports SQL-enabled lists with the ``-6'' switch:


                  % ezmlm-make other_switches -6 'host:port:user:pw:db:table' \
                          dir dot local host




     Will create an SQL-enabled list that uses the SQL server for the
     main list subscribers, digest list subscribers (if configured) and
     ``allow'' poster alias addresses (if configured).

  ezmlm-sub(1), ezmlm-unsub(1), and ezmlm-list(1) work as you would
  expect also with a SQL-enabled list. ezmlm-list(1) may be minimally
  slower (depending on network speed) if the SQL server is not local.
  ezmlm-sub(1) and ezmlm-unsub(1) will be faster, but this is noticeable
  only with very large subscriber lists and addition/removal of large
  numbers of addresses (more than several thousands).

  Just like other programs, ezmlm-list(1), ezmlm-sub(1), and ezmlm-
  unsub(1) will work with normal address databases in the absence of
  DDIIRR//ssqqll.  However, they also have a ``-M'' switch to force this
  behavior even in the presence of DDIIRR//ssqqll. This is used to convert an
  address database from the standard type to the SQL type:


               % ezmlm-list -M dir | xargs ezmlm-sub dir




  or from the SQL version to the standard type:


               % ezmlm-list dir | xargs ezmlm-sub -M dir




  To synchronize the two, remove one and then update it with ezmlm-
  sub(1) from the other. Alternatively, sort the ezmlm-list(1) output
  for both, use diff and sed/awk to get separate files of the differ-
  ences, and use ezmlm-sub(1) and ezmlm-unsub(1) to apply the differ-
  ences to the appropriate database.

  This type of conversion can serve as a convenient means to convert a
  list from one type to another, to back up databases, and to move
  subscriber addresses from a standard list to a SQL table for other
  purposes, or from a SQL database to a standard mailing list (you may
  need to use addresses from a SQL table, without wanting your lists to
  be dependent on an SQL server for day to day operation).

  _N_o_t_e_: This inter-conversion requires the DDIIRR//ssqqll file. If you do not
  run the list against an SQL server, you need to disable deliveries
  before you temporarily create this file. Otherwise, the list will run
  against the SQL database during the time DDIIRR//ssqqll exists.

  ezmlm-idx-0.40 simplifies the SQL support and queries over ezmlm-
  idx-0.32 at the cost of dropping distributed sublist support. We have
  figured out a simpler way to support the latter, which hopefully will
  be incorporated into ezmlm in the future (written under contract).

  With the simplification, the queries are very straight forward, and
  tuning is indicated only under extreme circumstances (very many very
  large and busy lists or constant addition/removal of many addresses).

  Weekly to monthly error checks on MySQL tables is recommended. Best is
  to use:


               # isamchk -s -O readbuffer=2M */*.ISM




  Other options allow automatic correction of errors, but are dangerous
  if tables are accessed while isamchk is running.

  Other isamchk options allow recovery of space after frequent
  insert/delete of addresses (can also be done with ``OPTIMIZE TABLE''),
  key optimization, etc.  See the MySQL documentation (
  <http://www.tcx.se>) for more info.

  +o  Do messages to ezmlm return an error message to the sender or not?

  +o  What is/are the error message(s)?

  +o  What does ezmlm log into the mail log?

  +o  Are you using a setup with virtual domains, and qmail<1.02 or
     ezmlm-idx<0.31? If so, have you adjusted DDIIRR//iinnllooccaall (see
     ``Adapting ezmlm-make for virtual domains'')?

  +o  Are posts sent out to the subscribers?

  +o  Are there subscribers?


       %  ezmlm-list DIR




  +o  Are there moderators?



  % ezmlm-list moddir




  where ``moddir'' is the contents of DDIIRR//rreemmoottee (for remote admin
  lists), of DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb (for subscription moderated lists) or DDIIRR//mmoodd--
  ppoosstt (for message moderation), if and only if the contents start with
  a forward slash. The default in all cases is DDIIRR//mmoodd//. If both
  DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb and DDIIRR//rreemmoottee contain directory names, the one in DDIIRR//mmoodd--
  ssuubb is used for both subscription moderation and remote admin.

  +o  Are the ownerships of all files correct, i.e. read/writable for the
     owner?


       % chown -R user DIR




  For lists under alias:


       % chown -R alias DIR




  If you use custom moderator databases, those directories and all their
  contents must also be readable for the user under which the list oper-
  ates (i.e. the user qmail changes to during the delivery).

  +o  Read the qmail log and capture relevant parts.

  +o  Did you customize the package at all? If so, try the default
     settings which are known to work.

  +o  Did you customize eezzmmllmmrrcc((55))? Try to use the default copy (skip the
     -c switch).

  +o  Did your customization of ..eezzmmllmmrrcc fail to have an effect?
     Remember to use the -c switch. The ..eezzmmllmmrrcc file used is the one in
     ``dotdir'', i.e. the directory where the ..qqmmaaiill files go, usually,
     but NOT necessarily, the one in your home directory.

  +o  Make sure you followed the instructions in man pages and other
     documentation. Most of the problems are due to not closely
     following the instructions. Try again with a new test list.

  +o  Make sure to take notes of how the list was created (which flags
     you used, etc.).

  +o  use ezmlm-check(1) (see ``Using ezmlm-check to find setup
     errors'').  and compare the variables identified by ezmlm-check to
     DDIIRR//iinnllooccaall, etc. If you don't get a reply from ezmlm-check, then
     message was not delivered properly. Check your qmail setup.

  +o  Try to find your problem or a question/item close to it in the FAQ.

  +o  If this didn't resolve the problem, post to the ezmlm mailing list,
     describing how you set up the list, your general setup (especially
     the relevant control files for a virtual domain), what works and
     what doesn't and what results from different actions (log entries,
     error messages).

  If you have solved a problem that you believe might be more general,
  please send a description of the problem and its solution to the
  authors, ideally as a FAQ item.

  If you have found a bug in the ezmlm-idx additions, please send a bug
  report by E-mail to bruce@untroubled.org. Describe the error, your
  setup, and your system in sufficient detail so that it can be
  reproduced by third parties. Include relevant sections of mail log,
  and information about any error messages returned. If you ran into a
  problem and resolved it on your own, include a fix as a context diff
  against the distribution.

  If you have found a bug in ezmlm proper (unlikely), please send a
  similar bug report to djb@cr.yp.to or ezmlm@list.cr.yp.to. If you're
  unsure where the bug is, you can start with bruce@untroubled.org.  If
  you have problems and questions, please refer to the documentation,
  then to mailing list archives, then E-mail the ezmlm mailing list or
  the authors.

  ezmlm-test(1) tests the different ezmlm(-idx) programs. It is useful
  to test your installation. If this program succeeds, it is not likely
  that you have problems due to platform-specific ezmlm(-idx) bugs. If
  ezmlm-test(1) fails, this is the place to start. The program is good
  at finding problems but not that easy to use to determine the cause.
  Start by finding the place where it fails, recreate the conditions
  (add ``exit 0'' just before the point of failure and set the
  environment variables as set by the script), then try to run the
  command manually. ~~//____TTSSTTDDIIRR____eerrrr may contain a relevant error
  message.  For further help, E-mail bruce@untroubled.org.

  ezmlm-check(1) is included in the ezmlm-idx distribution. ezmlm-
  check(1) is an evolving shell script which when put into a ..qqmmaaiill file
  of a mailing list will return information about the environment
  variables passed by qmail to ezmlm as well as the list setup. It also
  attempts to check for common error conditions, such as HOST and
  DDIIRR//iinnhhoosstt mismatch, missing files, etc. To use ezmlm-check(1), place
  a line:


       |/usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-check 'DIR'




  where ``DIR'' is the list directory, as the first line in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr
  (for mail to list), DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr (for mail to list-subscribe, list-
  help, etc), DDIIRR//mmooddeerraattoorr (for mail to list-accept, list-reject).
  ezmlm-check(1) will send its output to SENDER. The rest of the ..qqmmaaiill
  file will be ignored.  If you use a non-standard ezmlm binary direc-
  tory, change the ezmlm-check(1) path accordingly.

  ezmlm-check(1) in combination with mail logs and ezmlm error messages
  should make it easy to diagnose setup problems. When done, don't
  forget to remove the ezmlm-check(1) line. It is not security-proofed
  against SENDER manipulation and with it in place, the list won't work.

  ezmlm-check(1) does not check all aspects of list generation, but
  catches all common errors when lists are created with ezmlm-make(1),
  an many other errors as well. The ezmlm-check(1) reply is also very
  valuable for support via E-mail.


  66..66..  PPoossttss aarree rreejjeecctteedd:: SSoorrrryy,, nnoo mmaaiillbbooxx hheerree bbyy tthhaatt nnaammee
  ((##55..11..11))..

  qmail tried to deliver the mail, but there is no mailbox with that
  name.  ezmlm-make(1) was used with incorrect arguments, often in
  conjunction with a virtual domain setup. If the list is in a virtual
  domain, the ``host'' argument for ezmlm-make(1) should be the virtual
  domain, not the real host name.  See ``What names can I use for my
  mailing lists?''  and ``Lists in virtual domains'' for more info.

  Other possibilities are that your qmail setup is incorrect.  For a
  virtual domain controlled by user ``virt'', create ~~vviirrtt//..qqmmaaiill--tteesstt
  containing ``|/bin/echo "It worked"; exit 100''. Now send mail to
  test@virtual.dom. If delivery works, you should get an error message
  ``It worked'' back. If you get anything else, you need to adjust your
  qmail setup. Similarly, for a normal user, create ~~uusseerr//..qqmmaaiill--tteesstt
  and mail user-test@host to test that you control extension addresses.
  If this fails, contact your system administrator or adjust your qmail
  setup.

  If these tests worked, but your list still does not, you most likely
  supplied an incorrect ``dot'' argument for ezmlm-manage(1). It should
  be ~~vviirrtt//..qqmmaaiill--tteesstt for the list test@virtual.dom and ~~uusseerr//..qqmmaaiill--
  tteesstt for the list user-test@host.

        1. Read the qmail log. Is your message delivered to the list?
           You can also:



             % cat DIR/num




        2. Send a message to the list.

        3. See if it was received/processed:



             % cat DIR/num




        If the number was incremented, the message went to the list, and
        was successfully sent out in the opinion of ezmlm-send(1)
        (ezmlm-send(1) doesn't mind if there are no subscribers, so
        check that there really are both moderators and subscribers.
        These are added with ezmlm-sub(1). You can not just put
        addresses into a text file!).


     MMeessssaaggee mmooddeerraatteedd lliissttss

        1. Check number of queued messages awaiting moderation:



             % ls -l DIR/mod/pending




        2. Send a message to the list.

        3. Check if another message was added to the queue:



             % ls -l DIR/mod/pending




        A new file should have appeared. If this file has the owner exe-
        cute bit set, it was successfully processed by ezmlm-store(1).
        If this is true, but no moderation request was sent, then con-
        tinue with ``Messages posted to the list do not result in moder-
        ation requests''. If there is no new file, the message did not
        reach ezmlm-store(1), or ezmlm-store(1) failed early. In both
        cases, the mail log should tell you more.

        If the message is there, but the owner execute bit is not set,
        ezmlm-store(1) failed.  Check the mail log. Possible reasons
        include a failure to find the ezmlm-send(1) binary or DDIIRR//mmssgg--
        ssiizzee is specified and the message body size is outside of the
        allowed range (again, this is accompanied by an error message
        and mail log entry).


     GGeenneerraall

        1. If the message was not received/processed, there should be an
           error message in the mail log.

        2. Fix temporary and permanent errors with the help of qmail and
           ezmlm documentation.

        3. If there is no log entry at all, then the mail went to
           another host. Check your qmail setup.

        4. If mail was delivered to the list, but not forwarded to the
           subscribers (check the qmail log - there should be an entry
           for a new delivery to the list), tthhee mmoosstt ccoommmmoonn eerrrroorr iiss
           tthhaatt tthheerree aarree nnoo ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss..  In this case, ezmlm-send(1)
           sends a message from list-help@host, and logs success, but no
           recipients are logged. To qmail, it is perfectly acceptable
           to send a message without recipients, so no error message is
           logged.

        5. Check subscribers:


                % ezmlm-list DIR




        6. Assure that ownerships are correct on the list directories:


                     % chown -R user DIR




        For lists owned by the ``alias'' user (in ~alias):


                     % chown -R alias DIR




        7. Most other problems should be easily corrected with the help
           of the qmail log.

  The command line you specified is incomplete. Usually, a command line
  argument has been omitted or a switch was placed after the other
  arguments rather than before.

  The same error is issued when you attempt to invoke ezmlm-make(1) with
  only the ``DIR'' argument without using the ``-e'' or ``-+'' switch.
  Other command line arguments can be omitted only when editing lists
  created or previously edited with ezmlm-make from ezmlm-idx>=0.23.

  Some special situations use ezmlm-make(1) as a general script
  processor, e.g.  the setting up of sublists with ezmlmsubrc(5) and of
  a global interface with ezmlmglrc(5). Here, there is no ``memory'' so
  all arguments have to be specified, even when using the ``-e'' or
  ``-+'' switches.

  This error occurs when ezmlm-make is used to set up a list, and it
  tries to create a directory or a ..qqmmaaiill--lliisstt link that already exists.
  Usually, this occurs because the list already exists. If you are
  creating a new list, first erase remnants of any old test lists by
  deleting the list directory and the link files: _N_O_T_E_: _D_O _N_O_T _U_S_E _T_H_E_S_E

  intended!



       % rm -rf DIR
       % rm -rf ~/.qmail-list ~/.qmail-list-*




  If you want to save some files (such as in DDIIRR//tteexxtt//), make backup
  copies first, run ezmlm-make, then copy the backups to DDIIRR//tteexxtt//. Of
  course, it is usually easier to create a custom ..eezzmmllmmrrcc, and than use
  that for all your lists.

  To use ezmlm-make(1) to modify an existing list, without changing the
  subscriber or moderator lists or the message archive, use the ezmlm-
  make ``-e'' switch. With this, you need to re-specify all desired
  switches. If instead you use ``-+'' you need to specify only switches
  that are changed/new.  NOTE: any customization that you've made to
  program files like DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr will be overwritten. For instance, if
  you manually added checks to DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr or added a pointer to a custom
  moderator database in e.g.  DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb these changes will be lost.  To
  retain such changes (especially ones that are common for several of
  your lists), place them in a local ~~//..eezzmmllmmrrcc file instead. You can
  either make such changes the default for your lists, or you can
  configure ~~//..eezzmmllmmrrcc so that they are added only if a specific ezmlm-
  make switch is used.  (see ``Customizing ezmlm-make operation'').

  ``Terminology: dotdir'') use the ezmlm-make(1) ``-c'' switch (see
  ``Customizing ezmlm-make operation'').  _N_o_t_e_: The default location for
  a global edited eezzmmllmmrrcc file is //eettcc//eezzmmllmm//eezzmmllmmrrcc as of ezmlm-

  Make sure this is an indexed list and has an ``ezmlm-get'' line first
  in DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr. If not, your commands are fed directly to ezmlm-
  manage(1). If they contain ``-'', ezmlm-manage interprets the rest as
  an address to which it sends the error message.  Usually, this results
  in a "trash address" mail log entry and a bounce, which is why you
  don't see any error message. The same happens if you send non-existing
  commands followed by ``-'' and arguments. Thus, list-gugu-54@host
  results in an ezmlm-manage error, resulting in help text being sent to
  54@localhost ... When testing, try using syntax with a ``.'', not a
  ``-'', after the action command, e.g. list-get.54_60@host. This will
  assure that error messages get back to you.

  (Digest triggering by mail is a relic from older versions. Use the
  standard setup with ezmlm-tstdig(1) as by ezmlm-make(1) ``-d'', or run
  ezmlm-get(1) directly from the command line via crond(8).)

  If you get an error message, it tells you why the request failed. If
  you do not, see the previous item. Try using syntax without ``-''
  after the ``dig'' command. Also, requests that would result in an
  empty digest are silently ignored, but the reason why no digest was
  created is logged to the mail log. This is done so that cron scripts
  generating daily digest will just fail silently, rather than
  generating an error, for what isn't really one.

  Either the list is not set up for remote administration (i.e.
  DDIIRR//rreemmoottee does not exist), or the moderator is sending the request
  from an address that is not in the moderator database (e.g. from
  Fred@host.dom, when fred@host.dom is in the moderator db, but
  Fred@host.dom is not). ezmlm-manage(1) has no way of knowing that the
  SENDER is a moderator and treats the request as coming from a regular
  user, i.e. it sends a confirmation request to the target address.
  Correct the SENDER address, the address in the moderator db, or create
  DDIIRR//rreemmoottee. If you are using a non-default moderator db location, make
  sure that the moddir name is in DDIIRR//rreemmoottee (for remote admin only) or
  DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb (if there is subscription moderation as well). In both
  cases, the contents will be ignored unless they start with a ``/''.

  With normal ezmlm lists, a subscriber confirming a subscription or a
  non-subscriber confirming a unsubscribe request results in a message
  to the target address. This message is suppressed when the list is set
  up for subscription and/or remote administration, so that
  confirmations from multiple moderators do not result in multiple
  messages to the target address. The target address is always notified
  if the subscriber status of the address changes (from non-subscriber
  to subscriber or vice versa).

  The list is not set up as a moderated list. Check DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr.  If

  is a moderated list. No ezmlm-send(1) line should be in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr.
  If there is, the list is not moderated. Also, DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt must exist.

  ezmlm-send(1)) without sending them out for moderation first. This
  makes it easy to temporarily remove message moderation by simply
  removing DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt, but may be confusing if the user is unaware of
  this ezmlm-store(1) feature.

  +o  Check that DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr contains ezmlm-store(1) and not ezmlm-
     send(1).  If this is not the case, the list is not message
     moderated.

  +o  Check qmail logs for error conditions during post delivery and
     correct these. If the messages are delivered correctly, verify that
     ezmlm-store(1) generated the moderation requests to the moderators.

  +o  Check to see that there are indeed moderators:



       % ezmlm-list moddir




  where ``moddir'' is the contents of DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt if they start with a
  ``/'', otherwise those of DDIIRR//rreemmoottee (same ``/'' requirement), and
  DDIIRR//mmoodd// by default.

     Another common problem is directory ownerships, especially for
     lists under ~alias. To correct this error, issue the following
     command while in the ~alias directory (User the user/group of the
     list owner; for ~alias lists user=alias, group=qmail):

     is a copy of ezmlm-send(1) in the ezmlm binary directory.

  +o  Check the qmail log to see that the replies were delivered to this
     address.

  +o  Check directory ownerships. For lists under alias:



       % chown -R alias DIR




  _N_O_T_E_: This needs to be done every time you add/remove moderators as
  ``root''. For user-controlled lists (i.e. you are ``user'' when run-
  ning e.g. ezmlm-sub(1)) this is not a problem.

  If setting up lists for _a_l_i_a_s, you can avoid many problems by setting
  them up as ``alias'', i.e. use ``su alias'' not ``su''.

  If setting up lists for a user controlling a virtual domain, you can
  avoid many problems by assuming that uid (``su user'') before making
  any changes.

  +o  Check the qmail logs: After the delivery of the moderation request,
     ezmlm-send(1) should run to send messages to all the list
     subscribers.

  +o  Make sure there are list subscribers:



       % ezmlm-list DIR




  Most error conditions, incorrect request cookies, etc, should result
  in informative error messages in the mail log.

  Moderator comments are where the moderator chooses to ``reject'' the
  message and inform the person posting which his/her message was
  inappropriate.  However, if a moderator wants to comment on aacccceepptteedd
  posts, the moderator may only do so via a follow-up post to the list.
  This is to avoid anonymously tagged-on text to posts. If a moderator
  has something to say to the list, they should (and can only) do so in
  regular posts. If you want to edit posts before sending them to the
  list, set up a moderated list with you as the only moderator. Into
  DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr before the ezmlm-store(1) line, put a condredirect(1) line
  that redirects all messages with a SENDER other than you to your
  address. You can edit the contents ands repost, the message will pass
  condredirect(1), and hit ezmlm-store(1). You will be asked to confirm
  (needed to assure that nobody else can post directly) and when you do,
  the messages is posted.

  Moderator comments for ``reject(ed)'' posts need to be enclosed
  between two lines (yes, the end marker is required), having ``%%%''
  starting on one of the first 5 positions of the line. If there are
  characters before the marker, these will be removed from any comment
  line that starts with the same characters (e.g. the characters before
  ``comment2'' in the example below will be removed):

  By default, only a subset of message headers are sent out in any
  digest and archive retrieval requests. First, headers in
  DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerrrreemmoovvee are stripped. Most non-essential headers are excluded
  when the default archive retrieval format (``m'') is used.  Use the
  ``v'' or ``n'' format (see ezmlm-get(1)) to get all message headers
  that are in the archive.

  ezmlm-idx>=0.313 removes all but the latest ``Received:'' header from
  messages sent to the list. This is done since messages, especially
  sent via sublists, may have so many ``Received:'' headers that MTAs
  with primitive ``loop detection'' erroneously reject them. The
  subscriber can subscribe, since those messages have fewer such
  headers, and will receive warning and probe messages, but never see
  any posts.

  To see all headers of a message for diagnostic purposes, mail
  mainlist-getv.num@mainhost, where ``num'' is the message number.  All
  ``Received:'' headers are stored in the archive copy of the message.

  To disable ``Received:'' header pruning, use the ezmlm-send(1) ``-r''
  switch.

  The digest by default removed non-essential headers like ``In-Reply-
  To:'' from messages. Modern MUAs, like _M_u_t_t can split out messages
  from a digest and then thread them based on such headers. To include
  these and all other headers in the digest messages, use the ``v'' or
  ``n'' format as described on the ezmlm-get(1) man page. Normally, the
  threading done by ezmlm is sufficient and the default format preferred
  to reduce message and digest size, often by 25% or more.

  The list you are trying to post to is used as a sublist (a list fed
  with messages from another (ezmlm) list), but not properly set up as a
  sublist. Put  the name of the parent list (``origlist@orighost'')
  which exactly matches the SENDER of the original (or parent) list into
  DDIIRR//ssuubblliisstt.  Check the ownership of DDIIRR//ssuubblliisstt, to make sure that
  the user controlling the list can read it.

  Alternatively, use the ezmlm-make(1) ``-0 origlist@orighost'' switch
  (see ``Customizing ezmlm-make operation'').

  Assuming that the user initiated the subscribe request, got a
  ``confirm'' request, and replied correctly, there are two possible
  causes for the problem: Either the list is not subscription moderated
  (in this case the user is subscribed and received a note saying so) or
  the list is subscription moderated but no moderators have been added
  (ezmlm-manage(1) sends out the request and doesn't mind that there are
  no recipients).

  Check that the list is subscription moderated:


  % cat DIR/modsub




  If this fails the list is not subscription moderated. If it succeeds
  with a directory name, this is your ``moddir''.  If not:



       % cat DIR/remote




  If this succeeds with a directory name, this is your moddir, otherwise
  the moddir is ``DDIIRR//mmoodd//''.

  Check for moderators:



       % ezmlm-list moddir




  If there are none, this is your problem. If there are some, check the
  mail log to see what happened when the CONFIRM requests was supposed
  to have gone out. Assure correct ownerships for the moderator db:



       % chown -R user moddir




  For ~alias:



        # chown -R alias moddir




  Another possible problem is that you are trying to use the remote
  admin feature to subscribe a user, but you get no CONFIRM request.
  Usually, this is due to your SENDER address not being in the moderator
  database.  The CONFIRM request went to the target address instead,
  since as far as ezmlm is concerned, you are a regular user.

  Usually, this is due to a corrupted qmail queue (should affect all
  mail) or a corrupted ezmlm subscriber database (See ``How to deal with
  corrupted subscriber lists'').  ezmlm-idx>=0.40 has more informative
  qmail error messages.

  Dan has made ezmlm very robust, but a subscriber list can still become
  corrupted due to e.g. disk errors. Usually, this will lead to a
  ``temporary qmail-queue error'' because an address does not conform to
  the standard format. Occasionally, two E-mail addresses are fused,
  e.g.  ``addr1@hostTaddr2@host''.  To diagnose and fix this type of
  error, disable deliveries (easiest is to ``chmod 0 DIR/lock''), back
  up the contents of DDIIRR//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//, then:



       % ezmlm-list DIR > tmp.tmp

               ( edit tmp.tmp to fix any problems )

       % rm -rf DIR/subscribers/*
       % ezmlm-sub DIR < tmp.tmp




  This will list all E-mail addresses, allow you to edit them, then re-
  subscribe them.  Don't forget to re-enable deliveries.

  Standard vacation programs do not reply to messages that contain a
  ``Precedence: bulk'' header. ezmlm-idx>=0.23 sets up lists with this
  header in DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerraadddd. For older lists, use ``ezmlm-make -+'' or
  ``ezmlm-make -e'' to update them, or just add a ``Precedence: bulk''
  line to DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerraadddd.

  In the default setup, ezmlm-tstdig(1) determines if a new digest is
  due every time a message arrives to the list. Thus, even though ezmlm-
  tstdig is set to produce digests 48 hours after the previous digest,
  the digest will not be generated until a message arrives. If you'd
  like digests at a specific time each day, use crond(8) and crontab(1)
  to daily run:


               % ezmlm-get DIR

  Occasionally, a subscriber address is misconfigured and automatically
  sends a message back to the list. Sometimes, the subscriber's setup
  has removed headers that ezmlm uses for loop detection or the
  generated messages has nothing in common with the send-out. To block
  such mail at the list, include the ezmlm-make(1) ``-k'' (kill) switch
  and add the offending address to DDIIRR//ddeennyy// with


               % ezmlm-sub DIR deny badadr@badhost




  ezmlm-unsub(1) and ezmlm-list(1) can be used similarly to remove or
  list the addresses. If your list is configured for remote administra-
  tion (see ``How remote administration works''), and you are a remote
  administrator, you can add the address by sending mail to list-deny-
  badadr=badhost@listhost. Other subscriber database commands work as
  well for list-deny.

  In other instances, a configuration error somewhere close to the
  subscriber creates a local mail loop throwing off messages to you.
  They are often bounces that are sent to the list address or to ``list-
  help'' due to configuration errors. Rather than accepting these, or
  the often resulting double bounces to ``postmaster'', just add a
  ``|/path/ezmlm-weed'' line first to DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr or DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr. This
  discards the bounce messages generated by the looping systems. ezmlm-
  weed(1) is also useful in other settings where excessive numbers of
  error messages are sent to the wrong address.

  ezmlm lists (ezmlm-idx>=0.31) remove ``Received:'' headers from
  incoming messages by default. This can be prevented with the ezmlm-
  send(1) ``-r'' switch.  When the headers are propagated, especially
  sublist message may have many (15-20 or more), ``Received:'' headers.
  If there is a poorly configured sendmail host with a ``hopcount'' set
  too low, it will bounce these messages, incorrectly believing that the
  many ``Received:'' headers are due to a mail loop.  The reason that
  administrative from the list do not bounce is that they have fewer
  ``Received:'' headers, since they originate from the sublist.

  The message with all headers including the removed ``Received:''
  headers can be retrieved from the list archive with the _-_g_e_t_v command.
  The top incoming ``Received:'' header is added by qmail at the receipt
  to the list (or last sublist) host. This header is not removed, to
  allow the recipient to determine when the message reached the list.

  With ezmlm-make(1) (from ezmlm-idx >=0.21) you can use the ``-e''
  switch to edit existing lists.  Invoke the ezmlm-make(1) command just
  as you would to create the list anew, but change the switches to
  reflect the desired change, and add the ``-e'' switch. ezmlm-make will
  accept preexisting directories and overwrite or remove files to change
  the setup.  The message counter (DDIIRR//nnuumm), digest counters (DDIIRR//ddiiggnnuumm
  and DDIIRR//ddiiggiissssuuee), the key (DDIIRR//kkeeyy) and the message archive will not
  be affected.

  If the list has been created or previously edited with ezmlm-make(1)
  from ezmlm-idx>=0.23, the list remembers (via DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg) the
  arguments and the switches. All you have to do is to use the ezmlm-
  make(1) ``-+'' switch and specify options you wish to change, or use
  the ``-e'' switch and specify all non-default options you'd like to
  use.

  _N_O_T_E_: ezmlm-make(1) ``-e'' and ``-+'' will OVERWRITE any manual
  customizations you have made to the program files, but not text files
  and DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerraadddd, DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerrrreemmoovvee, etc. To reset all such files
  (such as when changing list name), use ``-ee'' or ``-++''.

  To make general customizations, please change eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) (see ``What
  is ezmlmrc?''  or read on) instead and use the ``-c'' switch as well.
  DO NOT use this option to change production lists without testing it
  on other lists first.  Also, for some changes, removing or adding a
  flag is sufficient (see ``How do I quickly change properties of my
  list'').


  77..22..  WWhhaatt iiss eezzmmllmmrrcc??

  ezmlm-make(1) has a number of default switches that through eezzmmllmmrrcc((55))
  have defined functions. These allow creation of many standard lists.

  In addition, ezmlm-make(1) operation is fully customizable via
  modification of the template file, ezmlmrc(5) or .ezmlmrc. A default
  ezmlmrc(5) is installed in the ezmlm binary directory.  The system
  administrator can install a system-wide default eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) file in
  //eettcc//eezzmmllmmrrcc (or symlinked from there) which overrides the file in the
  ezmlm binary directory. If the ezmlm-make(1) ``-c'' (custom) switch is
  used, ezmlm-make(1) will look for ..eezzmmllmmrrcc in the ``dotdir'', i.e. the
  directory in which the ..qqmmaaiill--lliisstt links are placed. This is usually a
  set directory for a given user/virtual domain (usually, the home
  directory for the user controlling the lists).

  eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) controls everything except creation of the list directory
  itself and the key used for cookie generation. The syntax of
  eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) is documented in ezmlm-make(1), the ezmlmrc(5) man page,
  and in the ezmlmrc(5) file installed in the ezmlm binary directory.
  ezmlm-make limits its effects to within the list ``dot'' and ``DIR''
  directories. In the ``dotdir'', only links to within ``DIR'' can be
  created.

  Copy the ezmlmrc(5) file from the ezmlm bin directory to ..eezzmmllmmrrcc in
  your ..qqmmaaiill file base directory (usually your home directory):


       % cp /usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlmrc ~/.ezmlmrc




  The base eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) file lives in the ezmlm binary directory, which
  may differ from ``//uussrr//llooccaall//bbiinn//eezzmmllmm//eezzmmllmmrrcc'' if you do not have a
  default setup.  If your system administrator has placed a ezmlmrc(5)
  file into the //eettcc directory, start with that one instead, as it is
  likely to already contain some useful local customization and
  comments.

  Now edit ~~//..eezzmmllmmrrcc. Find the tag corresponding to the text file you
  want to change, e.g. ``</text/mod-request/>'', and modify it
  appropriately. Some tags have conditional flags, so that succeeding
  text is copied only if specific switches are on/off. Thus, text

  only if the ezmlm-make(1) ``-rms'' switches are all used. For more
  info, see documentation in eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) and the ezmlm-make(1) man page.
  To invoke a custom ..eezzmmllmmrrcc file, use the ezmlm-make(1) ``-c''
  (custom) switch.

  This is not necessary if you use qmail>=1.02 and ezmlm-idx>=0.32.

  The problem with virtual domains is that ezmlm-make(1) by default puts
  the list name in DDIIRR//iinnllooccaall. However, if the domain host1.dom.com is
  controlled by the user ``virt'', then the local part of the address
  for the list list@host.dom.com will be ``virt-list'', not ``list''.
  This is easily accommodated by putting a ..eezzmmllmmrrcc file in ~~vviirrtt//.  In
  the ``</inlocal/>'' section of this file, enter ``virt-<#L#>'' instead
  of ``<#L#>''.  Now, all lists created under ~~vviirrtt will be
  automatically set up correctly.

  Similarly, if host1.dom.com is controlled by virt-dom1 and
  host2.dom.com by ``virt-dom2'', inlocal for list list@host1.dom.com
  should be ``virt-dom1-list'' and for list@host2.dom.com should be
  ``virt-dom2-list''. To accommodate this, put ``virt-<#1#>-<#L#>'' in
  ``</inlocal/>''.

  Running:


       % ezmlm-make -c ~virt/LIST ~virt/.qmail-dom1-list \
                  list host1.dom.com




  will produce a LLIISSTT//iinnllooccaall of virt-dom1-list by substituting the
  first part between two ``-'' (dom1) for ``<#1#>''. Two levels of
  dashes are accommodated, i.e. ``<#2#>'' will be replaced by the second
  part between two ``-'' (in this case empty (_S_i_c_!)).  For more info,
  see ezmlm-make(1) and comments in eezzmmllmmrrcc.

  Ezmlm-make is very flexible. There are only three sets of special
  command line switches: ``-vV'' for version info, ``-cC'' controlling
  the use of a custom file ..eezzmmllmmrrcc in the ``dot'' directory, and
  ``-eE'' for edit mode (i.e. reconfiguration of existing list setups).
  All other switches are soft, i.e. controlled through eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)).  Many
  switches, have special meanings via eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) and are documented in
  the man page. Any other switches can be used for customization (_N_O_T_E_:
  _w_e _m_a_y _u_s_e _s_w_i_t_c_h_e_s _o_t_h_e_r _t_h_a_n _`_`_-_x_y_z_'_' _f_o_r _s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c _p_u_r_p_o_s_e_s _i_n
  _f_u_t_u_r_e _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_s_.)  The ``-xyz'' switches will always be available for
  your use, with the ``-x'' switch being configured for some
  demo/special features in the distributed eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)).  You can use them
  for anything you like. They are by default off=false. The complement
  of these switches is ``-XYZ'' (by default on=true). You can use these
  to cause specific changes in the list setup if a given switch is used.
  For an example, see the ``-x'' switch as used and documented in the
  default eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) file.  The switches ``-aip'' are set by default to
  be backwards compatible with ezmlm-0.53. Other switches are ``off'' by
  default.

  Switches ``-a-z'' and ``-A-Z'' take no arguments.  Switches ``-0'' and
  and ``-3-9'' take arguments.  When the ezmlm-make(1) ``-+'' switch is
  used, the current settings for all these switches are read from the
  list's DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg (if available).

  SPAM or junk mail is usually sent by mailing a single message to a
  large number of (unwilling) recipients. As such, it usually does not
  contain the E-mail address of all recipients (remember, junk mailers
  pay for these address lists). By rejecting messages that do not have
  the list address in the To: or Cc: header(s) a large fraction of spam
  to the list can be filtered out.

  This filter function is activated by default, but will work only if
  you specify the list directory on the ezmlm-reject(1) command line. To
  disable this restriction, remove the ``DIR'' argument from the ezmlm-
  reject(1) command line, or add the ``-T'' switch.

  By default, this error is logged, and an error message is sent to the
  sender.  Since virtually all the failures will be SPAM and virtually
  all spam has a faked SENDER, most of these error messages will go to
  the postmaster.  Thus, you may want to use the ezmlm-reject ``-q''
  switch (quiet) to suppress the sender notification.

  ezmlm automatically detects are rejects messages that are sent from
  other ezmlm mailing lists. Some other mailing list managers do not use
  a rigorous mechanisms to verify subscribers. Thus, it is possible to
  subscribe an ezmlm list address to such a mailing list. You can easily
  block such a list by adding the address to the ``deny'' if you use the
  ezmlm-make(1) ``-k'' option. However, you can also configure ezmlm-
  reject(1) to reject messages based on specific headers placed into
  DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerrrreejjeecctt. A set of headers which will catch mailing list
  managers known to us are listed in the ezmlm-reject(1) man page. To
  activate this option, you must specify the ``-h'' switch and DDIIRR on
  the ezmlm-reject(1) line in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr. Naturally, you can make this
  the default by editing ezmlmrc(5) (See ``Customizing ezmlm-make

  ezmlm-reject(1) is by default configured to reject posts with empty
  subject (``-s'' switch) or with a subject that consists of only an
  administrative command word (``-c'' switch), such as ``subscribe''. To
  remove these restrictions, use the ezmlm-reject(1) ``-S'' and ``-C''
  switch, respectively. You can also into DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr before the ezmlm-
  send(1) line add:


               | grep -i 'subject:' | grep -if DIR/bad_words >/dev/null && \
                       {echo "bad words found"; exit 100; }

  greater than ``0'', then any posts with a body larger than the number
  specified is rejected. The maximum message size can optionally be
  followed by ``:'' and a minimum message body size in bytes.  For
  moderated lists, messages that are too large are rejected and not sent
  to the moderators. This feature can be used to prevent the posting an
  entire digest to the list by setting DDIIRR//mmssggssiizzee slightly below the
  message size set in your ezmlm-tstdig(1) innovation (if any). A
  minimum size can catch a few administrative request sent to the main

               </msgsize/>

  Use message moderation. As an alternative, implement a check against
  SENDER by using ezmlm-issubn(1). The latter is easily defeated by
  faking SENDER. Also, it prevents posts from legitimate subscribers
  that are subscribed under a different address than the one they send
  from.  Nevertheless, it may be useful in some situations. Add:



       |/usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-issubn 'DIR' 'DIR/digest' 'DIR/allow' ||
          { echo "Sorry, you are not allowed to post to this list.";
            exit 100; }




  _A_L_L _O_N _O_N_E _L_I_N_E to DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr before the ezmlm-send(1) line. ``DIR''
  is the main list directory. If your ezmlm binaries live in a different
  directory, change the ezmlm-issubn(1) path accordingly. If you would
  like denied posts to be dropped silently rather than bounced, change
  the exit code to 99.

  See ``Customizing ezmlm-make operation'' if you want your lists to
  have some of these features by default or set by specific ezmlm-
  make(1) switches. The ezmlm-make(1) ``-u'' switch by default sets up
  restrictions this way.


  If you do not want to allow digest subscribers to post, remove
  DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt// from the ezmlm-issubn command line. To allow posts from an
  address that is not a subscriber, simply add it to the addresses in
  DDIIRR//aallllooww//:


               % ezmlm-sub DIR allow address@host




  The ``allow'' database can be manipulated remotely by sending mail to
  list-allow-subscribe@listhost, list-allow-unsubscribe@listhost, etc.
  If configured for the list, the ``-list'' command for remote adminis-
  trators will work for the ``allow'' database as well.

  Please note that this setup is not secure, as it is easy to modify the
  envelope SENDER. For more secure options, see ``Restricting posts to
  an arbitrary set of E-mail addresses (higher security option)''.

  The easiest way to achieve this is to simply set up a message
  moderated list, and add all the e-mail addresses to the moderator db.
  Use a custom location, if you want a different set of moderators for
  subscription moderation/remote admin. If a "moderator" posts, only
  s/he will get a confirmation request. If anybody else posts, the post
  will be sent to all moderators.


  To directly bounce posts from SENDERs not in the database, use the
  ezmlm-store ``-P'' (not public) switch. This is more secure than a
  simple ezmlm-issubn(1) construct, since faking SENDER to a moderator
  address will result in a confirmation request to that moderator (which
  s/he will reject/ignore), rather than a direct post. The draw-back is
  that each post has to be confirmed, but with the speed of ezmlm the
  request will arrive immediately after the post is made, so the
  overhead should is The best choice depends on your particular needs in
  the trade-off between security and convenience.

  ``ezmlm-make -om'' will set up such a moderated list with ``ezmlm-
  store -P''.  This is the most useful setup for an announcement list.


  Setting a list up in this way with only the owner's address gives you
  a pretty safe owner-only list.

  To completely prevent posting (for instance a message-of-the-day

  DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr altogether. Make posts from the shell, or from shell

       % /usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-send DIR < message




  _N_O_T_E: This can be done by any user with write access to files within
  the list directory, so make sure your file modes are set correctly.
  The ezmlm-send(1) path may need to be changed to match your ezmlm
  binary directory. It's also a good idea to not allow others to read
  your list directory and DDIIRR//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss// and other address lists.

  As discussed above, the security afforded by SENDER checks is minimal,
  but nevertheless sufficient to keep out most spam and garbage.
  However, some subscribers post from e-mail addresses other than their
  subscription address, and users tend to become unfriendly when their
  posts are denied even though they are subscribers. This is a general
  solution to this problem which has minimal overhead for the list owner
  and is essentially completely transparent to the subscriber.

  Set up the list with ezmlm-gate(1) in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr in place of the
  ezmlm-send(1) line.  To the ezmlm-gate(1) command line add the list
  directory twice, then a digest directory DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt// (if it exists),
  then DDIIRR//aallllooww//.  Create DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt. Add the list owner as a message
  moderator.

  With this setup, any message from a SENDER that is a subscriber of the
  main list, the digest list or added to DDIIRR//aallllooww//, will be posted
  directly, others will be sent to the list owner for approval. If the
  list wants to automatically approve posts from that address in future
  (e.g. it is an alias for a subscriber) s/he just adds it to the
  database in DDIIRR//aallllooww//.  If the owner wants to approve this post, but
  not necessarily future posts from that address, s/he just accepts the
  message. To reject the message with a comment is equally easy. If the
  owner wished to have the option to silently ignore posts (and not have
  the SENDER notified that the post timed out), just add the ezmlm-
  clean(1) ``-R'' switch in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr and DDIIRR//mmooddeerraattoorr.

  In this way, the normal subscriber is always happy and the ``behind
  the scenes'' work of the owner is minimalized.

  ezmlm-make creates lists with this setup if you specify the ``-u''
  switch in addition to the ``-m'' switch:



               % ezmlm-make -mu ~/list ~/.qmail-list joe-list host




  If you omit the ``-m'' switch, the setup will reject posts from non-
  subscribers that are not in the ``allow'' database.  ezmlm-both(1)
  uses a set of similar ezmlm-make(1) invocations to create a list with
  digest, optionally making you a remote admin, list owner, and
  subscriber to both lists.

  Put the text in DDIIRR//tteexxtt//ttrraaiilleerr. The text is NOT copied to the

  ``<#h#>'', ``<#l#>'', and ``<#n#>'' are replaced by the list host,
  local name, and current message number, respectively.

  Put the exact text in DDIIRR//pprreeffiixx. You can include the message number
  assigned to the post in the list archive by adding the ``#'' character
  in the text in DDIIRR//pprreeffiixx (example: put ``lsqb;listname-#rsqb;'' in
  DDIIRR//pprreeffiixx).  ezmlm does not modify the subject other than by
  prefixing it with the prefix.  ezmlm knows about rfc2047 encoded
  subject and can detect a prefix within an encoded word. However, ezmlm
  will not modify the subject itself. It will add a prefix only of none
  has been added before. A consequence of this is that a message will
  have the message number prefix of the first message in the thread
  rather than a prefix with the number of the message itself. The entire
  thread can always be retrieved with a message to list-thread-x@host,
  where ``x'' is the number in the prefix.

  We recommend against using the prefix feature and strongly against the
  message number prefix. If you use it, make sure you understand the
  drawbacks, of message modification and subjects that change between
  message and reply.  ezmlm can deal with this, but other programs may
  not be able to.

  Sublists ignore DDIIRR//pprreeffiixx.

  If you add a prefix, especially if you previously added it by other
  means (procmail, etc.), use ezmlm-idx to re-index the archive. Due to
  the way ezmlm-get(1) does threading from the subject, it works best if
  you use exactly the same prefix as you did before.

  ezmlm-idx-0.32, the following tags can be used in DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerraadddd, and
  will be substituted: <#n#> for the current message number, <#l#> for
  the local part of the list (this will be the digest list for digests),
  <#h#> for the host part of the list name. These substitutions are done
  at the time of message delivery, in contrast to the ``capital letter''
  tags substituted by ezmlm-make(1) when the list is set up.

  Don't! A sequence header may be useful for users whose systems don't
  pass on the ``Return-to:'' header to the MUA.

  Use DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerraadddd with a header of the type ``X-Sequence: <#n#>''.

  Bounced messages are identified by their local message numbers, i.e.
  when ezmlm sends you a message about which messages bounced, it refers
  to the message number of the sublist. To be consistent with these
  numbers, and a local sublist archive, use DDIIRR//sseeqquueennccee on the sublist,
  not the main list. To get consistent message numbering in digests,
  digest have the message number of the first message in the digest.

  ezmlm-idx tries to make message numbering problems with sublists a
  little easier: sublists use the incoming message number, but only when
  the sublist is not archived and not indexed. This restriction is
  necessary for security reasons. Otherwise, an attacker could wreak
  havoc in the local message archive by sending messages with faked
  message numbers in the SENDER.

  ezmlm-idx>=0.30 can strip parts from composite mime messages based on
  content type. Just put the appropriate content-types such as
  ``text/ms-word'' or ``text/html'' into DDIIRR//mmiimmeerreemmoovvee. This is
  automatically configured when using the ezmlm-make(1) ``-x'' switch.

  Sendmail still is being used on the majority of mail hubs. Sendmail
  has very primitive loop detection, bouncing messages based on
  excessive ``hopcount''.  The ``hopcount'' is determined by counting
  ``Received:'' headers. ezmlm by default propagates ``Received:''
  headers to facilitate message tracking. Thus, messages, especially
  from a sublist, can have a number of ``Received:'' headers that
  exceeds the ``hopcount'' set on poorly configured sendmail hosts.
  Subscription confirmation requests, warning, and probe messages have
  fewer ``Received:'' headers. Thus, a user may be able to receive
  these, but not (some of the) list messages. Of course, the best is to
  correct the configuration on the bouncing host, but this is often
  under the control of neither list owner nor user.

  To compensate for this problem, ezmlm-send(1) of ezmlm-idx->=0.313 by
  default removes all ``Received:'' headers except the top one.  They
  are still written to the archive, an can be retrieved from there using
  the ``-getv'' command.  To cause ezmlm-send(1) to pass on all the
  ``Received:'' headers, use the ezmlm-send(1) ``-r'' switch.

  This is not recommended, since it leads to dissemination via the list
  of messages returned from bad auto-responders and MTAs. Also, it may
  lead to public replies to the list where personal replies were
  intended. In addition, the original ``Reply-To:'' header is lost. If
  you do want to add a reply-to list header, put ``reply-to'' into
  DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerrrreemmoovvee, and ``Reply-To: list@host.dom'' into DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerraadddd.

  For most mailing lists, you want all subscribers, including the sender
  of a particular message, to get all messages. This way, the sender
  sees that the message reached the list. For small lists, such as a
  project group, it may be annoying for the members to receive their own
  posts.

  ezmlm-send(1) can be configured to exclude the sender from the
  recipient E-mail addresses if configured with the ``-C'' switch. To
  add this switch, edit the ezmlm-send(1) line of DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr.

  Most of ezmlm's more commonly used messages are stored in DDIIRR//tteexxtt//.
  These messages can be edited manually for a list once it is set up, or
  on a global basis via modification of eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)).  The messages may
  also be edited via E-mail by remote administrators (remote admin must
  also be enabled - ezmlm-make switch ``-r'') after the list is
  established by creating the list using the ezmlm-make(1) ``-n'' (new
  text files) (see ``How text file editing works'' and see ``Customizing
  ezmlm-make operation'').

  The most useful messages are DDIIRR//tteexxtt//ssuubb--ookk (and for subscription
  moderated lists DDIIRR//tteexxtt//mmoodd--ssuubb) for new subscriber information (such

  All ezmlm replies, except errors handled directly by qmail, can be
  sent in any character set and optionally with quoted-printable or
  base64 content-transfer-encoding. DDIIRR//tteexxtt// files are always 8-bit
  files, but even though qmail has no problems with 8-bit mail, other
  MTAs and MUAs do.  Problems due to this can be avoided by assuring
  that outgoing ezmlm messages are 7bit by using the appropriate
  content-transfer-encoding.

  To specify a character set, put the name in DDIIRR//cchhaarrsseett (default: us-
  ascii). To specify quoted-printable or base64 content-transfer-
  encoding, add ``:Q'' or ``:B'' after the character set name in
  DDIIRR//cchhaarrsseett.

  Add a format (f) specifier after the archive retrieval command:



       list-getf@host




  where ``f'' is ``r'' for rfc1153 format, ``m'' (mime; default) for
  MIME multipart/digest with subset of ordered headers, and ``v'' (vir-
  gin) MIME multipart/digest, i.e. with all headers retained from the
  archive, and ``n'' (native) the same as ``v'' except that no threading
  is performed and messages are returned in numerical order.  Under some
  circumstances, it may be preferable to have a digest in ``multi-
  part/mixed''.  The ``x'' (mixed) format is identical to ``m'' except
  for this header.

  For ezmlm-cron(1), just suffix the format code to the digest code.

  The ezmlm-get(1) ``-f'' switch can be used to change the default
  format (MIME with removal of less relevant headers) to other formats.
  The format specifiers are the same as for individual archive
  retrievals (see ``Specifying the format for retrieved messages'').

  By default, a single -get request returns a maximum of 100 messages,

  MAXINDEX in iiddxx..hh and recompiling. Remember to edit tteexxtt//bboottttoomm,

  If you use ezmlm-get(1), archive retrieval can be restricted by using
  the ezmlm-make(1) ``-g'' (guard archive) switch. This in turn sets
  ezmlm-get(1) up with its ``-s'' switch, allowing access only to
  addresses that are subscribers of the list, or of the digest list, or
  that are present in an extra address database stored in DDIIRR//aallllooww//.
  Addresses can be added remotely by mailing list-allow-
  useralias=userhost@listhost. Other commands, such as ``subscribe''
  work as expected. As you can see, the different programs have many
  options and ezmlm-make(1) organizes most of them into the most useful
  sets to make it easier. Don't hesitate to look at the ezmlmrc(5) man
  page and man pages for individual commands. There are many useful
  options to more finely tune your lists to your taste. Via modification
  of ezmlmrc(5) you can make your favorite options the default!

  Since ezmlm-get always sends the reply to SENDER, this assures that
  only subscribers can get archive excerpts. Since SENDER is easily
  faked, anyone can still request archive info (and drain system
  resources), but replies go only to subscriber E-mail addresses.  The
  DDIIRR//aallllooww// database can be used to manually add addresses that should
  be given archive access, but are not subscribers. This may be an
  address of a subscriber who posts from an address other than his or
  her subscription address.

  If you want to disable all archive retrieval except digest creation,
  simply add the ``-C'' command line switch to the ezmlm-get(1) line in
  DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr. If you don't want digest creation via trigger messages
  and DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr, but use other means to created digests, you can
  remove the ezmlm-get(1) line from DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr.

  If DDIIRR//ppuubblliicc does not exist, ezmlm-manage(1) and ezmlm-get(1) modify
  their behavior. They disallow user requests, but for remote
  administration lists, honor moderator requests.  Thus, for a remote
  admin list without DDIIRR//ppuubblliicc, only subscription moderators or remote
  administrators can receive archive retrievals and only remote
  administrators can subscribe and unsubscribe user addresses.

  If you'd like this restriction of archive retrieval with maintained
  user-initiated ezmlm-manage(1) subscription functions, use the ezmlm-
  get(1) ``-P'' (not public) switch, and retain DDIIRR//ppuubblliicc. Also, look
  at the ezmlm-make ``-b'' switch.

  A non-public list lacks DDIIRR//ppuubblliicc. ezmlm-manage(1) will reject user

  ``-p'' (public) switch.

  Digests are integrated with normal ezmlm lists if you use ezmlm-
  idx>=0.30.  Just add the ezmlm-make(1) ``-d'' switch to your list
  setup. To add digests to an existing list created with ezmlm-idx>=0.23
  use:


               % ezmlm-make -+d DIR




  For ezmlm-0.53 or older lists, you just need to re-specify also other
  switches and the other ezmlm-make(1) arguments.

  The easiest way to generate trigger messages is to use crond(8) and
  execute ezmlm-get(1) daily. To do this, create the list with:


               ezmlm-make -d dir dot local host




  and add a line to your crontab file:


               30 04 * * * ezmlm-get dir




  and execute crontab(1). This will generate a digest each day at 04:30
  am. In addition, a digest will be generated at any time when the lat-
  est post makes it more than 30 messages or more than 64 kbytes of mes-
  sage body since the latest digest. If you do not want these extra
  digests, edit DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr and remove the ezmlm-tstdig(1) and ezmlm-
  get(1) lines.

  If you do not need the digests to go out at a particular time, use the
  standard setup, but edit DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr to put ``-t 24'' on the ezmlm-
  tstdig(1) line instead of the default ``-t 48'' for 48 hours. This is
  even easier.  You can modify all parameters by editing eezzmmllmmrrcc or by
  using the ezmlm-make(1) ``-4'' argument when creating/editing the
  list. This is described in the ezmlm-make(1) man page, and the options
  etc, are described in the ezmlm-tstdig(1) man page.

  If you want the next digest to start at message 456, you can always
  edit DDIIRR//ddiiggnnuumm to contain '455'. If you want the next digest to be

  You can control the default format that ezmlm-get(1) uses for its
  output by using the ``-f x'' switch. For individual digests triggered
  by mail or other archive access, add a format specifier after the
  digestcode:



       list-dig.codef@host




  For example:



       joe-sos-dig.gagax@id.com




  where ``x'' is ``r'' for rfc1153 format, ``m'' (default) for MIME mul-
  tipart/digest with a subset of headers, ``v'' for virgin MIME multi-
  part/digest, i.e. with all headers retained from the archive, ``n''
  produces format similar to ``v'', without threading and with messages
  in numerical order. The ``x'' format is identical to the default ``m''
  format, but the digest content-type is ``multipart/alternative''
  rather than ``multipart/digest''. This helps with a pine bug if you
  are using quoted-printable/base64 encoding of ezmlm messages.

  With digests triggered directly from crond(8), just use the ``-f''
  format specifier:


               ezmlm-get -fx DIR




  The same switch can also be used for standard digest triggering from
  DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr. Just add the ``-fx'' switch to the ezmlm-get(1) command
  line there. Edit ~~//eezzmmllmmrrcc to assure that such customizations will be
  used for future list creations/edits.

  The time out for bounce messages is normally 11.6 days. This means
  that a bad address will take longer that 3 weeks to be removed.
  Usually, this delay is desirable. After all, it is much worse to
  remove a subscriber just because the address had temporary problems
  that to send a few extra messages and receive a few extra bounces.

  However, for large lists, bounce handling can consume a considerable
  amount of resources. To decrease the load, remove all ezmlm-warn(1)
  lines from the DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr, and DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr files. Instead, execute:


       /path/ezmlm-warn DIR
       /path/ezmlm-warn -d DIR




  daily during off-peak hours via a cron script. The second line can be
  omitted if you are not using the digest capability of the list.

  This should not be necessary for ezmlm-idx>=0.32. That version adds
  much more efficient bounce handling, making this type of modification
  usable only for extremely large lists with many bad addresses (unusual
  for ezmlm lists) and for hosts that are working near the limit of
  their capacity (where shifting some qmail load to off-peak hours is
  worth the effort).

  In addition, you may want to reduce the time out for bounces from 11.6
  to a lower number of days, e.g. 5. To do so, add ``-t 5'' to the
  ezmlm-warn(1) command line.

  If you start with a list from a list manager that does not have bounce
  handling, chances are that you have many bad addresses in your list.
  You can always execute:


       /path/ezmlm-warn -t0 DIR
       /path/ezmlm-warn -d -t0 DIR




  to move bounce handling one step forward per execution. Users whose
  mail has bounced will be sent a warning. Users for whom the warning
  message has bounced will be sent a probe.

  On any list, the DDIIRR//aallllooww// database can be manipulated remotely via
  mail to list-allow-subscribe@listhost, etc. The rules for
  adding/removing/listing addresses to this database are the same as for
  the main list. Thus, if a user on an open list wants to be able to
  post from alias@al.host.com s/he can send a message to list-allow-
  subscribe-alias=al.host.com@listhost and reply to the confirmation
  request. Now, s/he can post from this address even on a subscriber-
  only list and even though the address is not a real subscriber.

  It can be confusing to some users that you use ``subscribe'' here, but
  you don't get any messages. If you explain to them that this is just
  another collection of addresses they will understand. You can also
  send the initial message on their behalf. If you are a remote admin,
  you can even complete the transaction adding the alias without
  subscriber participation.

  Addresses can also be unsubscribed from the ``allow'' database.
  However, there is usually no good reason to do so.

  If configured, the DDIIRR//ddeennyy// database can be manipulated, but only by
  remote administrators, by mail to e.g.  list-deny-
  baduser=badhost@listhost. Normal users cannot access this database.

  To remotely administrate the DDIIRR//mmoodd// databases (i.e., without shell
  access), you need to set up a non-public, remotely administered list
  which ``resides'' within the DDIIRR//mmoodd. _P_l_e_a_s_e _c_a_r_e_f_u_l_l_y _c_o_n_s_i_d_e_r _t_h_e

  After setting up your list with the specific functionality you need,
  use the following command for DDIIRR//mmoodd//:


               % ezmlm-make -ePrIAl ~/list/mod ~/.qmail-list-mod joe-list-mod host




  The '-l' flag is not necessary, but makes it easier to administrate
  your moderator database by permitting the ``supermoderator'' to see
  who is on the list.

  The new list does not have a key. Using the key from the main list is
  inadvisable. Instead, create a dummy list, copy the key from this list
  to your ``moderator'' list:


               % cp ~/DUMMY/key ~/DIR/mod/key




  Erase the dummy list. Also, posts to this list should not be allowed.
  Erase the ~~//..qqmmaaiill--lliisstt--mmoodd and ~~//DDIIRR//mmoodd//eeddiittoorr.  Then add the remote
  administrator of the ``moderator'' list:


               % ezmlm-sub ~/list mod/mod supermod@superhost




  The ``supermoderator'' can now remotely administrate the moderators of
  the main list.

  Request for moderation of posts can be forwarded to any address and
  acted on from that address. By default, all post moderation requests
  have subjects starting with ``MODERATE for'' followed by the list
  name.

  1133..33..  MMooddeerraattiinngg ssuubbssccrriippttiioonn ffrroomm aa sseeccoonnddaarryy aaccccoouunntt..

  Requests for moderator approval of user subscribe requests can be
  forwarded to any address and acted on from that address.  All
  subscription moderation requests have subjects starting with
  ``CONFIRM'' (or ``CONFIRM subscribe to listname'', since ``CONFIRM
  unsubscribe from listname'' is sent to the moderator only in reply to
  a moderator-initiated request on a list with remote admin).

  Remote administration (initiation by the moderator of (un)subscribe
  requests on behalf of a user) CANNOT be initiated from an account that
  is not listed in the moderator database. If such attempts are made,
  these will be treated as regular requests, resulting in a confirm
  request to the user (which includes a copy of the initial request,
  revealing the moderator's address to the user). The user reply to a
  confirm request will on a non-moderated list result in the addition of
  the user address to the subscriber list, and in a moderated list a
  CONFIRM request to all the moderators. Replies to unsubscribe confirm
  requests always result in the removal of the address, without
  moderator intervention (except in some cases when the ezmlm-manage -U
  switch is used (see below)).  With this caveat, moderation and remote
  administration can be done from a secondary address.

  For the subscription moderator to temporarily use a different address,
  s/he needs to forward all ``CONFIRM'' messages to the new address. For
  a permanent move, it is better to remove the old moderator address and
  add the new SENDER address to allow moderator-initiated (un)subscribes
  without user intervention from the new address (of course, the list
  has to be configured for remote administration with DDIIRR//rreemmoottee).

  Sometimes, it may be desirable for the moderator to automatically
  approve all moderation requests. This may be appropriate for a single
  moderator of a ``civilized'' list when away for the week.

  Set up your client to auto-reply to the ``Reply-To:'' address for all
  messages with subjects ``CONFIRM subscribe to listname'' or ``MODERATE
  for listname''. Beware that this can be used by malicious people to
  trick your account to send mail anywhere.  In practice, this should
  not be a problem.  If you are worried, forward the messages to a
  (trusted) friend and ask him/her to appropriately reply to the
  requests.

  Access to the subscriber list is sensitive. Thus, this option is
  disabled by default. The ezmlm-manage(1) ``-l'' command line switch
  enables this option, but will send a subscriber list only to a
  moderator's address. This allows a moderator to also initiate a
  subscriber list retrieval from a secondary account (i.e.  one to which
  the moderator's mail is delivered, but for which SENDER is not a
  moderator). The latter option does not decrease security, as it is
  trivial to fake SENDER (see ``Ezmlm-idx security'' for a discussion of
  ezmlm-idx security aspects).

  For maximum subscriber list security, do not enable this feature. To
  enable this feature by default, just modify eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) (see
  ``Customizing ezmlm-make operation'').

  This is restricted and works as the subscriber list, since it contains
  information of equal sensitivity. To receive the entire log, mail
  list-log@listhost.  See ``Howto get a subscription log'' for more
  details on the reply format.  As of ezmlm-idx-0.32, the subscription
  log also contains the From: line contents from the user's subscribe
  confirmation. This usually contains the user's name and can be helpful
  if the user cannot recall or determine the subscription address. To
  make life easier for the remote admin, ezmlm-idx-0.32 also supports
  searching the log, using exact matches for alphanumerics and ``_'' as
  a wild card character. Thus, to find records matching ``Keith John*'',
  the remote admin can mail list-log.Keith_John.  See ``Howto get a
  subscription log'' for more information.

  If you want any user to be able to get a subscriber list, you can set
  up a separate link to DDIIRR//lliisstt and then put in a script using ezmlm-
  list (See ``adding your own commands'' for more info.)  . The authors
  strongly urge against this, since a common method for spammers to get
  valid E-mail addresses from mailing lists is to exploit unrestricted
  -list commands.  A subscriber with questions about who is on the list
  should contact the list-owner@host. A subscriber wishing to confirm
  that they are still on the list can just send a message to list-
  subscribe@listhost, and reply to the confirm request. The following
  message will be a ``ezmlm response'' if the user was already a
  subscriber, and a ``WELCOME to listname'' if s/he was not.

  Proceed as in the previous point, but set up two different moddirs.

  and DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb) to contain absolute paths to the correct moddir.

  This is done by crating a list that has DDIIRR//mmoodd// as it's main list

  ``remotely adding moderators'').

  If this is a common setup for you, you can write a simple script
  creating both lists (plus a digest list, if desired) with one simple

  ``Customizing ezmlm-make operation'').

  You can also configure the list to allow remote administrators to edit
  files in DDIIRR//tteexxtt// via E-mail (see ``How text file editing works'').

  All you have to do is to pipe the corresponding message to ``ezmlm-
  send DIR''. Messages awaiting moderation are kept in DDIIRR//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg//.
  To find a particular file, grep the contents.  Thus, to find a file
  from user@host.dom, try:



       % grep 'user@host\.dom' DIR/mod/pending/*




  (Depending on your setup, you may not have to escape the period.)
  Check the files for the owner execute (``x'') bit. It is set on all
  messages queued successfully. Ignore other files!

  To then accept the message (change the ezmlm-send(1) path if you've
  installed in a non-default directory):



       % cat DIR/mod/pending/filename \
       % /usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-send DIR




  Alternatively, use ezmlm-accept(1).  It checks the 'x' bit, ezmlm-
  send(1) return codes, removes the file, etc.

  For example:



       % ezmlm-accept ~joe/SOS ~joe/SOS/pending/*




  will accept all messages in the queue of the list in ~~jjooee//SSOOSS//.

  Simply deleting the file from DDIIRR//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg// will do it. If you want
  to notify the sender, just send him/her an E-mail.  There is an easy
  way to get ezmlm-idx programs to do it for you: just wait and let
  ezmlm-clean(1) take care of it for you, once the message has timed out
  (number of hours settable within 24-240 in DDIIRR//mmooddttiimmee; default 120).

  A sublist is a list that receives its input from another mailing list,
  rather than from users directly. The sublist is just a regular
  subscriber of the main list. A sublist in e.g. Tasmania is very useful
  since only one message is sent from the main list and then the
  sublists servers all subscribers in Tasmania. Bounces and all
  administration is handled locally. The local sublist can have a
  digest, even though the main list may not.  (See ``How sublists work''
  for more info on how sublists work).

  To set up a sublist to an ezmlm list, just use the ezmlm-make ``-0
  mainlist@mainhost'' switch. This will configure your list as a sublist
  to the mainlist@mainhost mailing list.


  1144..22..  SSuubblliissttss ooff nnoonn--eezzmmllmm lliissttss..

  To set up a sublist to an ezmlm list, just use the ezmlm-make ``-0
  mainlist@mainhost'' switch. This will configure your list as a sublist
  to the mainlist@mainhost mailing list. Since the main list may not use
  the ``Mailing-List'' header, you must identify another header that the
  main list adds to all messages. See the ezmlm-reject(1) man page for
  examples. Next, edit DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr of your sublist and add a ``-h
  _L_i_s_t_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r_-_V_e_r_s_i_o_n_:'' option to the ezmlm-send(1) line, but
  replacing ``_L_i_s_t_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r_-_V_e_r_s_i_o_n_:'' with your mainlist header.

  Now your list will accept only messages from mainlist@mainhost and
  with the header specified.

  ezmlm-0.53 allows sublists. The difference between a sublist and a
  main list is that the sublist requires that the SENDER of the message
  is the main list and that the message has a ``Mailing-List:'' header.
  Sublist messages have their own subscriber database and subscription
  mechanism, and use their own message number. This is very convenient
  if you want to create a private sublist.  Since the subscribers have
  to interact with the appropriate sublist, it is difficult to
  administrate if you want to use it to distribute the load of a very
  large list, since users will have to address administrative requests
  such as unsubscribe to the correct sublist. Also, bounce messages
  refer to the sublist archive with sublist message numbers.

  ezmlm-idx modifies this in several ways: First, the message number of
  the incoming message is used also for the outgoing message so that
  subscribers see the same message number no matter which sublist they
  get it from. For security reasons, this is enabled only if the sublist
  is NOT ARCHIVED. With this feature, bounce messages can refer the user
  to the main list archive instead, obviating multiple archives.

  Second, ezmlm-split(1) can be used to forward administrative requests
  sent to the main list, to the appropriate sublist. Thus, subscribers
  interact only with the main list, and do not need to know which
  sublist that servers them. With bounce and administrative messages
  referring them to the main list, subscribers will usually be unaware
  of the sublisting.

  To set this up:

        Before the ezmlm-manage(1) line in DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr add:

        The main list sends to sublists and to any addresses not covered
        by the split table. You can split the load by domain
        (``geographically''), and any domain (including '') can be
        subdivided by ``hash'' by using different parts of the 0-52
        range. Of course, you can also use hash alone.  The request will
        go to the first row that matches, so although overlaps are not
        advisable (in case you later want to add sublists of switch to
        an SQL server-based system (see ``'')), they have no negative
        effects. The domain for ezmlm-split can be the last TWO parts,
        i.e. ``edu.wustl'' to handle all *.wustl.edu subscribers.  This
        is useful, but remember that the SQL version supports only one
        level.

        An example:


             domain:hash_lo:hash_hi:sublistname
             edu:0:52:sub1@here.edu
             com:0:26:sub2@there.net
             com:27:52:sub3@some.com
             :0:13:sub4@what.org
             :14:39:sub5@what.org




     As you can see, the entire ``edu'' domain is handled by
     sub1@here.edu.  The ``com'' domain is about evenly split between
     sub2@there.net and sub3@some.com.  Everything else is split so that
     approximately 1/4 goes to sub4@what.org, 1/2 to sub5@what.org and
     the rest falls through, i.e. is handled by the main list.

     Why are there 2 sublists on the same host? This is in preparation
     of adding a host. It easy to just move the entire sub5@what.org
     list to a new host.  All we have to do it to set up the new list,
     copy over the subscribers, and change the name in the split table
     entry.

     To split the split the sub5@what.org load onto 2 lists requires a
     little more work. First, create a dummy split table in a directory
     ``temp'':

        :14:26:new1@new.net
        :27:39:new1@other.net




     Next, split the subscribers of sub5@what.org into these 2 groups,
     as detailed in the ezmlm-split(1) man page. Create the two new
     lists, add the respective subscribers, and replace the
     sub5@what.org line with the two lines above.

     To add a totally new domain, e.g. jp:0:52:sub6@niko.jp requires
     collection or subscribers from all lists that currently handle
     these subscribers, (the ones with blank domain in the example), re-
     splitting them, and adjusting the subscribers. Easiest here is to
     just unsubscribe the sub6@niko.jp subscribers to be from the other
     list with ezmlm-sub(1).  Since that program will silently ignore
     any addresses that are not on the respective list, it will work
     fine.

        Use ezmlmsubrc which sets up a minimal non-archived sublist with
        bounce texts pointing to the main list:



                  % ezmlm-make -Cezmlmsubrc -3mainlocal -4mainhost \
                          DIR dot sub1local sub1host

        If you forget, the sublist will not get any messages to
        distribute. Add these addresses with ezmlm-sub(1) as subscribers
        to the main list.

  A strong point of this system is that it is relatively simple and that
  only a fraction of the addresses are available to any given sublist.
  Thus, compromised security at a sublist threatens only the addresses
  and functions handled by that sublist.

  As you can see, this works quite well, but it's not trivial to change
  the setup.  If you modify it while the list is running, some
  subscribers may get duplicate messages or miss messages. Therefore,
  you should disable deliveries to the main list before the final step
  of the changes (removal of subscribers from old lists and adding new
  lists as subscribers to the main list). For most lists, this should
  work flawlessly, and some minimal planning and extra lines in
  ``split'' can markedly facilitate future expansion.

  Another weak point is the authentication of messages between list and
  sublist.  The requirements the sublist places on the message can be
  easily faked. This allows injection of messages at the sublist level
  as a way to circumvent moderation or other access control.

  An associated disadvantage is that not even the main list has access
  to all the addresses. Thus, SENDER checks for archive access
  (relatively secure) and posts (relatively insecure) cannot directly be
  used. Also, sublist cooperation is required to determine the number of
  subscribers, or to access subscriber addresses for a purpose other
  than distribution of list messages.

  This section describes differences and similarities between ezmlm and
  other mailing list managers. It also details functions of ezmlm-idx
  that allow you to configure ezmlm to respond to commands utilized by
  such other mailing list managers so the command syntax will be
  familiar to such users.  Contributions to complete this sections are
  welcome.


  1155..11..  BBaassiicc CCoonncceeppttss..

  Ezmlm is different from other mailing list managers in that it is
  _l_i_s_t_-_c_e_n_t_r_i_c rather than _h_o_s_t_-_c_e_n_t_r_i_c. With a _l_i_s_t_-_c_e_n_t_r_i_c interface,
  you address the list directly with administrative commands. With
  ezmlm, the command is embedded in the list address thus becoming part
  of it (i.e., the ``command address''.)  With smartlist, again you
  address the list, but send all administrative commands to the list-
  request address. Ezmlm lists can support this if you use the ezmlm-
  make(1) ``-q'' switch to configure ezmlm-request(1) in DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr.

  Other mailing list managers are _h_o_s_t_-_c_e_n_t_r_i_c, i.e.  administrative
  commands for any list on that particular host are addressed to a
  central address such as majordomo@host, listserv@host, or
  listproc@host. Then the user is required to place the command in
  either the subject header or more commonly in the body text of the
  message. The listname has to be included with the command. [_N_o_t_e_: The
  above concept is not universally applicable to all host-centric
  mailing lists.  While intended to to used in a host-centric manner,
  many such mailing list managers also support listname-request@host
  addressing. See the applicable list manger documentation for details.
  Coverage of this aspect of other mailing list manager functionality is
  beyond the scope of this FAQ.]  To make the migration to ezmlm easier,
  support for a _h_o_s_t_-_c_e_n_t_r_i_c style mailing list manger is available.
  This is based on the use of ezmlm-request(1) with the ``-f
  ccoonnffiigg__ffiillee'' switch.


  1155..22..  SSeettttiinngg uupp eezzmmllmm ttoo rreessppoonndd ttoo hhoosstt--cceennttrriicc ccoommmmaannddss..

  ezmlm-request(1) can be used a a ``majordomo/listserv-emulator''. You
  can create the necessary accessory files manually. However, ezmlm-
  idx>=0.32 contains ezmlmglrc(5) which makes is very easy for you:


               % su
               # su alias
               # ezmlm-make -C/usr/local/bin/ezmlmglrc dir dot local host




  where ``local'' may be e.g. ``majordomo''. Even easier is to set it up
  under a virtual domain ``host'' controlled by a user ``user''. Just
  put ``user'' in place of ``alias'' in the example.

  If you use a character set other than US-ASCII, put it's name,
  optionally followed by ``:'' and the desired content-transfer-encoding
  character (``Q'' for quoted-printable and ``B'' for base64) into
  eezzddoommoo//cchhaarrsseett.

  All that remains is to set up DDIIRR//eezzddoommoo..ccff with information on the
  lists (local and/or remote) that you want to make accessible via this
  interface. Another script, ezmlm-glconf(1) can help you with this for
  your local lists. To configure for all your lists:

          ezmlm-glmake ~/ > ~/dir/ezdomo.cf




  See man page for details. Alternatively, do it manually:

  The DDIIRR//eezzddoommoo..ccff contains a list of mailing lists which the
  ``majordomo'' (in this case) can provide information about in the
  following syntax:


         list@host:listdir:description




  To show a list in ``lists'', but not include it in a ``which'' search,
  simply omit the ``listdir'' for that line:


         list@host::description




  For the ``which'' command to work, the DDIIRR//, which contains the
  subscriber database, must be readable by the user under which mail is
  delivered. This means that ``which'' is usually limited to lists owned
  by the user or virtual domain under which the ``ezdomo'' interface is
  set up.

  When set up as above, substituting ``listproc'' or ``listserv'' for
  ``majordomo'' as appropriate, ezmlm will recognize and respond to the

  Unlike ``listproc/listserv'' or ``majordomo'', ``smart-list'' does not
  provide ``host-centric'' services. Rather, commands are addressed to
  listname-request@host and the command placed on the ``Subject:'' line:


         To: listname-request@host
         Subject: command [subscriber@host]




  The body of the message is normally ignored.  If the subject is empty,
  the first body line that starts with a letter is interpreted.

  Ezmlm-idx is designed to make it as easy as possible to set up mailing
  lists.  The default setup works well for small and medium-sized lists.
  For large lists, the lists can be made more efficient with a few
  simple changes.


  1166..11..  CCrroonndd--ggeenneerraatteedd ddiiggeessttss ffoorr bbeetttteerr ppeerrffoorrmmaannccee..

  With the default setup, ezmlm-tstdig(1) in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr tests if a
  digest should be sent out. On lists with a lot of traffic this is
  inefficient.  Also, you may want digests to be delivered as a specific
  time. To do this, use crond(8) to execute ezmlm-get(1) directly, as
  described elsewhere.


  1166..22..  OOppttiimmiizziinngg eexxeeccuuttiioonn ooff eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn((11))..

  ezmlm-idx>=0.32 comes with much improved bounce handling. Modification
  as described below should be considered only when you expect thousands
  of bouncing addresses (virtually never). The description remains, for
  users of ezmlm-0.53 or earlier versions of ezmlm-idx. For users of
  ezmlm-0.53 alone, we recommend a patch
  (http://ezmlm.org/archive/patches/ezmlm-return.diff) which fixes a
  bug in ezmlm-0.53 bounce handling. The patch is superseded by ezmlm-
  idx.

  To redistribute the load of bounce warning and probe addresses to off-
  peak hours, you may want to set up the list without ezmlm-warn(1) by
  using the ezmlm-make ``-w'' switch, and instead execute ``ezmlm-warn
  DIR'' via crond(8). You also need to run ``ezmlm-warn -d DIR'' for
  digest bounces if your list is configured with digests. Normal ezmlm
  list with ezmlm-idx>=0.32 will have an insignificant bounce load,
  except if you bulk add addresses, e.g. from a MLM without bounce
  handling. In the latter case, the load will be higher for the first
  2-4 weeks, then decrease drastically. If you feel you need to run
  ezmlm-warn(1) from crond(8), you should seriously consider sublisting
  your lists.

  _N_o_t_e_: the ezmlm-make(1) ``-w'' switch has a special meaning if used at
  the same time as enabling SQL-support (``-6''; see man pages).


  1166..33..  DDeeccrreeaassiinngg eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn ttiimmee oouutt ttoo iinnccrreeaassee ppeerrffoorrmmaannccee..

  With ezmlm-idx, you may alter the ezmlm-warn(1) timeout to a number of
  seconds with the ``-t seconds'' switch.  The default is 1,000,000
  seconds or about 11.6 days. This is the time from the first bounce
  until ezmlm-warn(1) sends a warning message and the time from the
  warning message bounce until ezmlm-warn(1) sends a probe (which if
  bounced leads to removal of the address from the subscriber list).  If
  you have a digest list, remember to execute ezmlm-warn(1) with the
  ``-d'' switch as well.

  Decreasing the default to e.g. 5 days will cut in half the average
  number of files in the bounce directory and the number of messages
  sent at each crond(8)-directed invocation of ezmlm-warn(1). The trade-
  off is that worst case, a subscriber may be unsubscribed if his/her
  mail path is defective for more than twice the timeout. Removing a
  subscriber after 10 days seems reasonable on a busy list. Do this by
  adding the ``-t'' switch to all the ezmlm-warn(1) invocations. This
  timeout should be larger than the interval between ezmlm-warn(1)
  invocation.

  To be aggressive, use ``ezmlm-warn -t0''. This will minimize the time
  your lists spends servicing bounces, but will for some errors lead to
  subscribers to be also lead to subscribers being removed if messages
  to them bounce for two consecutive ezmlm-warn(1) runs. This is useful
  to rapidly clean up a low quality address collection.

  ezmlm-idx adds a number of functions to ezmlm. It indexes the archive,
  and adds an index entry for each message, it can remove MIME parts, it
  can add a subject prefix and message trailer, decode rfc2047-encoded
  subjects, etc.  Although designed to impact minimally on performance,
  these options when used take time. Even when they are not used, time
  is spent looking for e.g. the prefix. However, the performance penalty
  is small, as the absolutely dominating cost of a mailing list is the
  work qmail does to deliver the messages to subscribers.

  In bench marking, we have not found a significant difference in
  performance between ezmlm-0.53 and ezmlm-0.53+ezmlm-idx-0.32 when
  ezmlm-idx features are not used. Thus, a non-indexed list with ezmlm-
  idx-0.32 performs the same as the corresponding ezmlm-0.53 list.
  Adding an index adds the overhead of another safe write (the index
  file). Use of other features adds very marginally to execution time.
  For virtually all lists, the ezmlm execution time is negligible
  compared to the resources needed by qmail to disseminate the message
  to the subscribers.

  An archived list needs to write the message to the archive. If you
  don't need an archive, don't archive. However, the archive is very
  useful to allow users to catch up on messages that they didn't receive
  due to delivery problems.

  Consider splitting your list into sublists, ideally geographically.
  The main list deals only with a subset of subscribers (or only the
  sublists), and each sublist deals with a subset of subscribers,
  bounces, etc. This is the most rational way to scale ezmlm to large
  lists (see ``How sublists work'' for more info on how sublists work
  and ``Sublists'' on how to set up sublists).

               ezmlm-make -+ [changed_switches] dir




  ezmlm-make(1) stores configuration info in DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg and uses that
  info as the default when you use the ``-+'' switch. If the list was
  created with a very old version or ezmlm-0.53 ezmlm-make(1) you have
  to restate all arguments the first time you edit the list.

  The ``-e'' switch works the same, without stickiness for switches.

  A message arriving during reconfiguration may be handled incorrectly.
  The prudent user will set the sticky bit on the home directory to
  prevent delivery, then clear it after the list has been changed.

  This is the default setup. The main list generates digests in response
  to a mailed request or when a message arrives and the amount of
  messages since the last digest exceeds set limits (see ezmlm-
  tstdig(1)).  Alternatively, ezmlm-get(1) can be invoked from the
  command line. In both cases, the generated digest message is
  disseminated to the subscribers stored in DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//,
  i.e. the subscriber database with the base directory DDIIRR//ddiiggeesstt//.

  You can set up lists with combinations of message moderation,
  subscription moderation, and remote administration, easiest by
  combining ezmlm-make(1) ``-m'' ,``-s'', and ``-r'' switches. You can
  use a non-default moderator db, by specifying a directory starting
  with a slash in DDIIRR//mmooddssuubb or DDIIRR//rreemmoottee (for remote admin and
  subscription moderation - always the same db for both functions) or in
  DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt for message moderation. You can point several lists to the
  same moderator db, thus using the same moderators for several lists.
  _N_O_T_E_: The user controlling the list must have read/write access to the
  files (specifically, must be able to write the lock file).

  Some of these setups are not trivial. However, you can make them
  trivial by modifying ezmlmrc(5) so that ezmlm-make(1) can set up the
  desired lists by default or when the user uses e.g. the ``-y'' or
  ``-z'' switches (see ``Customizing ezmlm-make operation'').

  The need for a user handshake can be eliminated by the ezmlm-manage(1)
  ``-S'' (subscribe) and/or ``-U'' (unsubscribe) switches. Alone, this
  is very insecure. However, there may be some use for it in local lists
  with subscription moderation, or alone for notifications where ease of
  use is more important than preventing users from (un)subscribing
  others. If the list has subscription moderation or remote
  administration, any user subscribe or unsubscribe request is forwarded
  to the moderators if the SENDER and target address do not match, even
  if the ``-U/-S'' switches are specified. This is put in place to make
  a ``-U/-S'' list similar to other list managers, not for security
  (it's not secure, since a malicious outsider can easily fake the
  SENDER address). Unsubscribe confirmations are sent also to the target
  in this case, to avoid situations where the user needs moderator
  ``permission'' to get off the list.

  This is useful in many circumstances. A list announcing new programs

  Set up the list with ezmlm-make ``-m'' and the main developers as
  moderators. When any of these posts, that user alone is asked to
  confirm. Posts from other E-mail addresses are sent to all
  moderators/developers.  To use a different set of E-mail addresses as
  ``trusted e-mail addresses'' and moderators for other posts, use the
  ezmlm-store(1) ``-S'' switch and make a separate address database for
  the ``trusted E-mail addresses''.  Put the name of the basedir for the
  ``trusted e-mail addresses'' database in DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt (needs leading
  ``/''), and add the post moderator(s) to DDIIRR//mmoodd// using ezmlm-sub(1)
  as shown above.

  A general solution for SENDER checking is to configure list with
  ezmlm-gate(1).  ezmlm-gate(1) takes as arguments any number of
  basedirs for subscriber lists. Posts from SENDERs that are found are
  posted. For others ezmlm-store(1) is invoked. If DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt exists,
  ezmlm-store(1) will send out other messages for moderation.  To bounce
  such messages, create DDIIRR//mmooddppoosstt, and use the ezmlm-gate(1) ``-P''
  switch (will be passed on to ezmlm-store(1) to bounce any posts not
  from a moderator).

  By default, ezmlm-gate(1) accepts messages from subscribers. However,
  this is overridden if any ``basedirs'' are put on the ezmlm-gate(1)
  command line. Common would be to create a address list and put its
  ``basedir'' on the ezmlm-gate(1) command line. Trusted E-mail
  addresses can then be added with:
       % ezmlm-sub basedir trusted@host




  As this relies on SENDER checks it is less secure than the ezmlm-store
  based confirmation-requiring setup.

  Hopefully, the error messages for all parts will be synchronized in

  ezmlm commands can have aliases for use in translations for non-
  English use.  Due to the use of commands in mail e-mail addresses, the
  character set is limited by rfc822 to us-ascii. To enable the command
  aliases, remove the comment marks around the INTL_CMDS define in
  idx.h. Also, remove the comments from the define corresponding to one
  language (currently, only LANG_FR - French) available.

  The INTL_CMDS define results in the compilation of all ezmlm programs
  with support for alias commands for those commands listed in the INTL
  section (all that are used directly by users). All aliases MUST be
  defined, but should be the normal English commands. The language-
  specific sections un-define and redefine the commands for which
  alternative names should be used. This allows use of e.g.
  ``inscription'' as an alias in addition to the standard ``subscribe''.

  Most ezmlm responses are made from text files in DDIIRR//tteexxtt//. These are
  created from the template file ``ezmlmrc''. Thanks to Frank Denis, and

  Tegtmeyer, Torben Fjerdingstad, Jan Kasprzak, and Sebastian Andersson,
  French, Japanese, Portuguese (var. Brazil), Polish, German, Danish,

  or just copy eezzmmllmmrrcc..jjpp to //eettcc//eezzmmllmmrrcc, where it will override the
  copy installed in the ezmlm binary directory. For rpm packages, the
  en_US version is installed, but the other versions are available in
  the //uussrr//ddoocc// hierarchy.

  If you have made an eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) version for another language, please
  make it public domain and E-mail it as an attachment to
  bruce@untroubled.org. It will then be put into the eezzmmllmmrrcc directory
  of the distribution site. Please take advantage of the ``Content-
  transfer-encoding'' capability of ezmlm-idx>=0.30, if needed, as this
  avoids problems when messages are sent via non-8-bit MUAs.


  Other ezmlm responses, such as words in subject lines, are defines in
  iiddxx..hh and can be changed there. Error messages should ideally not be
  altered. However, it may make sense to change a few of them which are
  used as messages to e.g. remote administrators. The defines for all

  ezmlm, as far as we know, places no restrictions on character sets.
  The configurable default character set allows you to use other
  character sets for out going ezmlm messages. ezmlm-make does not _p_e_r
  _s_e support other character sets. However, any single-byte character
  set is supported, as long as the us-ascii character sequence ``</''
  does not occur anywhere as the first characters of the line, and the
  character sequence ``<#x#>'' (where ``x'' is any number, or A, B, C,
  D, F, H, L, R, T) does not occur anywhere is text (if it does, it
  risks being substituted). Also, any occurrence or ``<#A#>'' and
  ``<#R#>'' that is the first on any text line will be substituted by
  ezmlm-manage and ezmlm-store. Any occurrence of ``!A'' and ``!R'' as
  the first characters on a line will be substituted by ezmlm-manage and
  ezmlm-store.

  For multi-byte character codes, the same restrictions apply.  Thus,
  ``</'' at the start of a line will confuse ezmlm-make, and any
  ``<#x#>'' sequence within the text risks substitution. In practice,
  both of these should be very rare and easily avoidable when setting up
  an ezmlmrc(5).

  List subscribers should be informed that subscriptions to the list are
  controlled by a moderator.  ezmlm-idx in its default setup handles
  this notification during and after the subscribe handshake. Most of
  this can be disabled by manipulation of the DDIIRR//tteexxtt// files.

  List subscribers should be informed that posts to the list are
  moderated. ezmlm-idx does this by adding the ``Delivered-To: moderator
  for ...'' header, but IOHO, the list owner should make the fact of
  list moderation plain in introductory messages, or other means, to the
  list subscribers.

  With normal use of ezmlm-idx, the sender of a rejected post is
  notified that the post has been rejected and if the moderators chooses
  to comment, the sender receives this comment, usually describing why
  the post was rejected.  This ezmlm behavior cannot be disabled at run
  time.

  If post are neither accepted or rejected, they time out. ezmlm-
  clean(1) notifies the sender when this happens. This behavior can be
  disabled with the ezmlm-clean(1) ``-R'' (not return) switch, which has
  to be placed on the command line of all invocations of ezmlm-clean(1)
  (normally in DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr and DDIIRR//mmooddeerraattoorr).  If you for some reason do
  not wish to inform the sender of your editorial decision, you can use
  this switch and let undesirable posts time out, rather than actively
  rejecting them. IOHO, it is better to be "above board" and use the
  normal notification mechanisms, together with active rejection and
  informative rejection comments.

  The ezmlm-make(1) ``-u'' switch uses moderation in a slightly
  different way. Here, posts are restricted to subscribers, but posts
  from non-subscribers are sent to the moderator(s) rather that being
  ignored. This to help the subscriber that posts from an alias of the
  subscribed address, or the occasional non-subscriber. In this case it
  is perfectly acceptable to just ignore non-accepted posts. Thus, using
  the ezmlm-make(1) ``-u'' switch configures the ezmlm-clean(1)
  invocations with the ``-R'' switch.

  This document discusses security aspects of ezmlm-idx addition to the
  ezmlm-0.53 mailing list manager. This is the authors' understanding of
  security aspects of ezmlm-idx functions and not to be taken as a
  warranty. If you find any errors in this document or the ezmlm-idx
  package in general, please inform the authors.

  In general, ezmlm with or without the ezmlm-idx package is more secure
  and less resource hungry than most other mailing list managers. Better
  security than afforded by ezmlm +/- ezmlm-idx would require encryption
  or PGP/digital signatures. Such an addition would make it difficult,
  if not impossible, to run the mailing list from a standard MUA. The
  ezmlm-idx package adds a number of functions and options, which under
  some conditions may decrease security. The purpose of this document is
  to discuss security aspects of using/enabling these different
  functions.


  2211..22..  SSEENNDDEERR mmaanniippuullaattiioonn..

  We assume that the cost of manipulating/falsifying the SENDER address
  of a message is zero. Thus, any mechanism relying on SENDER alone is
  insecure. However, such a mechanism may help in case of simple mailer
  or user errors. We also assume that the "cookies" used by ezmlm are
  secure, i.e.  that it is very hard for someone to generate a valid
  cookie for a given address. SENDER is used to identify a moderator for
  remote administration of subscriptions. The result of the action or
  the confirmation request are sent back to that moderator address.
  Thus, providing a false SENDER is useless, unless the attacker can
  also read that moderator's mail.


  2211..33..  eezzmmllmm ccooookkiieess..

  Since ezmlm doesn't rely on the SENDER, the security lies entirely
  within the action-time-cookie-address combination.  Anyone obtaining a
  valid "combination" can do whatever the combination is meant to do,
  but nothing else. Also, the cookie times out 1000000 seconds
  (approximately 11.6 days) after it was issued. Since the
  "combinations" are specific for a particular action and address, they
  can only be reused for that particular purpose, and within 11.6 days.
  Ezmlm (un)subscriptions for a given address are usually pointless to
  repeat. Message moderation "combinations" are useless after they've
  been used, since the message is no longer in the moderation queue.

  Maliciously (un)subscribing an address with ezmlm-0.53 requires that
  the attacker is able to read mail sent to the subscription address.

  With the ezmlm-idx add-on, a non-moderated list works exactly the same
  way. Ezmlm-idx introduces the moderator for moderated and remote admin
  lists. For any moderator functions, an attacker needs to be able to
  read mail sent to a moderator's address. If s/he can do this, the
  attacker can affect anything the moderator is allowed to do (since
  falsifying SENDER is trivial). To minimize risks, give moderators only
  the power they need, do not use more moderators than necessary, and
  use moderators whose mail is hard to intercept (on the same
  machine/same internal/secure network or by encryption via e.g. ssh).


  2211..55..  MMeessssaaggee mmooddeerraattiioonn..

  A basic message moderated list keeps ezmlm subscriber security, but
  interpolates the moderator(s) between the address of the list and the
  list itself. An attacker able to read moderator mail can accept/reject
  a post, if s/he can do it before a regular moderator has taken action.
  The potential for abuse can be minimized by using few and local
  moderators. Mail logs are needed to trace which moderator address was
  misused.

  A basic subscription moderated list retains ezmlm subscriber security,
  but adds a moderator handshake. An attacker would need to be able to
  both read mail to the subscriber address and to at least one
  moderator.

  A remote admin (-r) list adds the ability of the moderator to
  (un)subscribe any address. The price of this is that an attacker able
  to read moderator mail can (un)subscribe any address. The moderator
  handshake message will be delivered to the abused moderator address,
  which will alert that moderator and reveal the compromise. Another
  basic assumption is that action-date-cookie-address combinations are
  only sent to the target address or a moderator and that moderator
  action "combinations" are never sent to non-moderators.

  ezmlm-manage(1) can allow remote administrators to edit files in
  DDIIRR//tteexxtt.  First, this option is disabled by default. Second, the
  ``-edit'' command is accepted only when the target (the recipient) is
  a remote administrator.  Third, only existing files within DDIIRR//tteexxtt
  are editable.  It is not possible to create files.

  ezmlm replies to a valid request with an informative message and the
  contents of the file. In addition, the ``Reply-To:'' address contains
  a cookie based on the file name and contents, as well as the current
  time.  Anyone possessing this cookie can save a new version of the
  text file. As with other ezmlm security, the security of this process
  depends on only the remote administrator receiving remote
  administrator mail. If this is not sufficiently secure for you, do not
  enable this option. As always, an increase in accessibility results
  results in a decrease in security.

  Cookies for editing expire in approximately 27 hours. Also, as soon as
  a file is changed, the cookie is invalidated since the file contents
  change.  This also means that an outstanding edit request cannot be
  completed if the files has been updated in the interim.

  A potential attacker obtaining a valid cookie has a window of
  opportunity while you edit the file, or for at most 27 hours. S/he can
  overwrite and existing text file with potentially offensive material.
  Usually, this can be achieved more easily by posting to the list. S/he
  can also potentially fill your disk with a large amount of data (up to
  two times 10240 bytes (limited by MAXEDIT in iiddxx..hh)) and could put
  part of this data onto messages leaving the list. Again, this is much
  more easily achieved by e.g. sending the equivalently sized message to
  your list.

  The archive retrieval functions added by ezmlm-idx are digests
  (protected by a "code") and other functions. Anyone who knows the
  digest code (through reading mail logs, reading DDIIRR//mmaannaaggeerr of the
  list, or reading any scripts used to send digest triggering messages)
  can trigger a digest. Protect these locations accordingly!  For
  default lists with digests triggered from DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr via ezmlm-
  tstdig(1) and ezmlm-get(1), you do not need the digest code and can
  thus disable the possibility to trigger digest by mail.  For other
  functions, the output is sent to SENDER and can be restricted to
  subscribers (the ``-s'' switch). ezmlm-get(1) functions (apart from
  digest) can be entirely disabled with the i``-C'' switch, or
  restricted to moderators with the ``-P'' switch or by removing
  DDIIRR//ppuubblliicc. Other sections of this document discuss several other
  options. All switches are documented in the man pages.

  The moderator support functions added by the ezmlm-idx package
  (extended help and subscriber list) are sent only to a moderator
  address, i.e. an attacker again needs to be able to read moderator
  mail to read the output. The help info (DDIIRR//tteexxtt//mmoodd--hheellpp) should not
  contain secrets. The ``-list'' function is normally disabled, but can
  be enabled with the ezmlm-manage -l switch to aid the remote
  administrator(s).

  ezmlm-manage(1) functions can be made more convenient, at the expense
  of security. There have been many requests for these options, so they
  have been added, although we recommend against using them:

  The ezmlm-manage(1) ``-S'' switch eliminates the subscriber handshake
  from subscribe requests. Thus, it is no longer necessary for the
  subscriber to confirm the subscription. This is not secure, but may be
  convenient for some moderated lists.  Use only with extreme caution.
  The ezmlm-manage(1) ``-U'' switch similarly eliminates subscriber
  confirmation from unsubscribe requests. Again, this is insecure and
  useful only under special circumstances. If the list has any
  moderators (remote or modsub), requests to (un)subscribe an address
  other than sender are still routed to a moderator. This is similar to
  how some other lists work. Naturally, this is insecure because it
  relies on SENDER.  Unsubscribe requests are always non-moderated,
  since, IOHO, it seems un-ethical to force a subscriber to remain on a
  list. Where an unsubscribe confirm request is sent out it is (also)
  sent to the target, except when the request was initiated by a
  moderator on a list with remote administration (DDIIRR//rreemmoottee exists).
  The (un)subscription target is always informed about completed
  (un)subscribe request, whether initiated by that address, another
  address, or by a moderator. Thus, attempts of a user or moderator to
  subscribe an address will be brought to the attention of the user
  receiving mail at that address.

  ezmlm-get(1) archive retrieval functions can be used to deplete system
  resources. However, this can also be done by posting messages to
  lists, mail bombing, etc. If you are worried about this, you can use a
  combination of ezmlm-manage/ezmlm-get ``-C'', ``-s'', and ``-P''
  switches, removal of DDIIRR//ppuubblliicc, and removal of the mail-triggered
  digest function (by removing the digest code from the ezmlm-get(1)
  command line) to decrease availability of these functions (see man
  pages). Digest can also be triggered by direct execution of ezmlm-get
  from within a script from DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr as in the default setup with the
  ezmlm-make(1) ``-d'' switch.

  Anyone getting messages from the list can see the ``Delivered-To:
  Moderator for ...'' header and realize that the list is moderated.  In
  the authors opinion, this is fair and appropriate. If this bothers
  you, edit the source of eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree..cc.

  While the fact that the list is moderated will be disclosed by the
  headers, the moderator(s)' identity will not be disclosed by the
  header. Moderators are anonymous to anyone who cannot directly read
  the mail log, the moderator list, or monitor your outgoing and
  incoming mail. Anyone intercepting the acting moderators' mail or able
  to read the mail log can determine who took a particular action.

  Moderator E-mail addresses are not (to our knowledge) disclosed by any
  ezmlm mechanism. Thus, the poster does not know who rejected/accepted
  the message. Other moderators can find out that the message was
  accepted (by seeing it on the list or by themselves committing to a
  reject/accept reply) or rejected (by being informed by the poster or
  by themselves committing to a reject/accept reply). If no moderator
  takes any action for a given time (120 h - configurable to anything
  24-240 h via DDIIRR//mmooddttiimmee - and the parameters are likewise
  configurable at compile time via iiddxx..hh) the message times out, an act
  for which no particular moderator can be held accountable.

  Subscription requests are acted upon only if a moderator completes the
  transaction by approving the requests. Requests can not be directly
  disapproved, but the associated cookie becomes invalid after
  approximately 11.6 days. Neither the subscriber nor the other
  moderators know which moderator accepted the subscription request.
  Requests to unsubscribe from the list are never moderated or otherwise
  controlled, except by requiring confirmation from the subscriber
  (normal unsubscribe) or the moderator that initiated the request
  (remote administration). If several moderators approve the same
  subscribe request, the user gets multiple notifications.

  The triggering message (the moderation approval or the moderator's
  completion of the subscription request) are not returned or logged.
  This protects moderator anonymity, but makes it harder to track down
  the offender in case of abuse. Only a good mail log will help. IOHO,
  abuse of these mechanisms requires considerably more effort that it is
  worth to (un)subscribe someone to a list.  Also, IOHO, moderator
  anonymity is more important. If this increased difficulty in tracking
  down abusive behavior bothers you, don't use the remote administration
  and moderated subscription features.

  The optional ``-list'' command enabled by the ``-l'' ezmlm-manage(1)
  command line switch returns a subscriber list to the moderator. Again,
  anyone who can intercept a moderators' mail can fake SENDER and use
  this command to obtain a subscriber list. The use of local moderators
  minimize the risk. If the risk of subscriber disclosure is not worth
  this convenience, do not enable this feature.

  reply to messages to list-help@host if the target address is a
  moderator.  DDIIRR//tteexxtt//mmoodd--hheellpp should not contain secrets or other
  confidential information.

  ezmlm sublists require that the message envelope sender is the main
  list, and that the message has a ``Mailing-List:'' header. Both are
  easy to fake, allowing an attacker to inject messages at the sublist
  level. Other than the possible ramifications of only a subset of
  subscribers seeing the message, this is of no concern for open lists.
  For a ``subscriber-only'' list based on SENDER checks, it is no harder
  to set SENDER to the address of a subscriber than to fake the headers
  required by the sublist. However, for a moderated list the mainlist to
  sublist communication becomes the weakest link. Sublists using a SQL
  database also use better authentication in this step (see ``SQL-
  enabled ezmlm lists'').

  A sublist user can unsubscribe a normal ezmlm sublist from the main
  list. To guard against this, you need to prevent propagation of
  unsubscribe confirm requests by the sublist. Easiest is to add a line
  to DDIIRR//eeddiittoorr before the ezmlm-send(1) line:


               |grep -i '^Subject: CONFIRM' >/dev/null 2>&1 && exit 99; exit 0




  Another option would be to take advantage of the fact that DDIIRR//hheeaaddeerr--
  aadddd headers at the main list are added to normal messages, but not to
  administrative messages. Thus, one could discard messages that lack
  the default ``Precedence: bulk'' header:


               |grep -i '^Precedence: bulk' >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 99; exit 0




  For lists with SQL-support, users cannot unsubscribe sublists (see
  ``SQL-enabled ezmlm lists'').

  Break-in at a sublist host for normal ezmlm lists leads to
  loss/compromise of the addresses handled by the sublist. For MySQL-
  enabled lists, the sublist access credentials give DELETE and SELECT
  access to all addresses serviced by the list. Thus, a successful
  sublist attacker can completely disable the list. The MySQL log (if
  used) will reveal from which host the attack was done. Although the
  potential damage to a SQL-enabled list is greater, the results are of
  the same order of magnitude. The risk in minimized by keeping control
  over all sublist hosts. A successful sublist attacker cannot normally
  add addresses, since the sublist users by default are set up without
  INSERT privileges to the address database.

  For SQL-enabled lists, the database contains all list information.
  Subversion of your database server allows an attacker to add/remove
  addresses at will.  This is also true for normal ezmlm lists. In
  addition, modification of the ``*_name'', ``*_cookie'', and ``*_mlog''
  tables can cause the list to misbehave in a manner that doesn't
  immediately suggest a security breach.  Keep your ezmlm list and
  database servers secure.
