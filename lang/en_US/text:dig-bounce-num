I've kept a list of which digests from the <#L#>-digest mailing list
have bounced from your address. For each digest you missed, I have
noted the number of the first message in the digest.

<=a=>
I do not archive the digests themselves, but you may be able to
get the messages from the main list archive.

To retrieve a set of messages 123-145 (a maximum of 100 per request),
send an empty message to:
   <<#L#>-get.123_145@<#h#>>

To receive a subject and author list for the last 100 or so messages,
send an empty message to:
   <<#L#>-index@<#h#>>

Here are the digest message numbers:
