The <#L#>-edit.file command can be used by a remote
administrator to edit the text files that make up the bulk
of the responses from the <#L#>@<#h#> list.

What follows is a list of the response file name and a short
description of when their contents are used.  To edit a file,
simply send mail to <#L#>-edit.file@<#h#>, substituting the
file name for 'file'. Editing instructions are mailed with
the text file.
