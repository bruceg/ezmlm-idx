I haven't checked whether your address is currently on the mailing list.
To see what address you used to subscribe, look at the messages you are
receiving from the mailing list. Each message has your address hidden
inside its return path; for example, mary@example.com receives
messages with return path:
<<#l#>-return-<number>-mary=example.com@<#h#>.

Some mail programs are broken and cannot handle long addresses. If you
cannot reply to this request, instead send a message to
<<#L#>-request@<#h#>> and put the entire address listed above
into the "Subject:" line.
