# Revision: 1
I'm sorry, I've been unable to carry out your request,
since the address

<#A#>

was not on the <#l#> mailing list when I received
your request and is not a subscriber of this list.

If you unsubscribe, but continue to receive mail, you're subscribed
under a different address than the one you currently use.
Please look at the header for:

'Return-Path: <<#l#>-return-1234-user=example.com@<#h#>>'

This shows that the subscription address is ``user@example.com''.
The unsubscribe address for this user would be:
'<#l#>-unsubscribe-user=example.com@<#h#>'.

Just mail to that address, adjusted for the real subscription address.

If the message has a ``List-Unsubscribe:'' header, you can send
a message to the address in that header. It contains the subscription
already coded into it.

For some mail programs, you need to make the headers visible to
see the return path:

For Eudora 4.0, click on the "Blah blah ..." button.
For PMMail, click on "Window->Show entire message/header". 

If this still doesn't work, I'm sorry to say that I can't help you.
Please FORWARD a list message together with a note about what you're
trying to achieve and a list of addresses that you might be subscribed
under to my owner:

    <<#l#>-owner@<#h#>>

who will take care of it. My owner is a little bit slower than I am, 
so please be patient.
