This is a generic help message. The message I received wasn't sent to
any of my command addresses.

Here is a list of the command addresses supported:

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <<#L#>-info@<#h#>>
   <<#L#>-faq@<#h#>>

<=d=>
Similar addresses exist for the digest list:
   <<#L#>-digest-subscribe@<#h#>>
   <<#L#>-digest-unsubscribe@<#h#>>

<=a=>
To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <<#L#>-get.123_145@<#h#>>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456, mail:
   <<#L#>-index.123_456@<#h#>>

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <<#L#>-thread.12345@<#h#>>

<==>
The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@example.com", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
    <<#L#>-subscribe-john=example.com@<#h#>>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
    <<#L#>-unsubscribe-john=example.com@<#h#>>
