# Revision: 2
Oops, that confirmation number appears to be invalid.

The most common reason for invalid numbers is expiration. I have to
receive confirmation of each request within ten days. Also, make sure
the entire confirmation number was in the reply you sent me. Some
e-mail programs have a habit of cutting off some of the reply address,
which can be quite long.

I've set up a new confirmation number. To confirm that you would like

<#A#>

removed from the <#l#> mailing list, please send an empty reply
to this address:

<#R#>
<=x=>

or click here:
	mailto:<#R#>
<=q=>

Some email programs contain bugs and can't handle long addresses.
If you cannot reply to this message, send a message to:

<<#L#>-request@<#h#>>

and paste the complete address found above into the Subject line.
<==>

Again, check the reply address carefully to make sure it is all included
before you confirm this action.

Sorry for the trouble.

	<#l#>-Owner <<#l#>-owner@<#h#>>
