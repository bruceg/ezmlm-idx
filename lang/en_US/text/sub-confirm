This confirmation serves two purposes. First, it verifies that I am able
to get mail through to you. Second, it protects you in case someone
forges a subscription request in your name.

Some mail programs are broken and cannot handle long addresses. If you
cannot reply to this request, instead send a message to
<<#L#>-request@<#h#>> and put the
