.SH NAME
ezmlm-reject \- reject messages unsuitable for distribution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-reject
[
.B \-bBcChHqQsStT
][
.I dir
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-reject
reads a mail message from its standard input.
It rejects the message if it sees something it doesn't like.

If the message has a ``Precedence: junk'' header,
.B ezmlm-reject
exits 99 causing the message to be ignored. This causes replies from (some)
vacation programs to be ignored.

If
.I dir
is specified,
.B ezmlm-reject
reads
.I dir\fB/msgsize
for a maximum:minimum message body size in bytes. Either number will be ignored
if 0 or omitted.
.B ezmlm-reject
will also look for
.I dir\fB/mimereject
and 
.IR dir\fB/mimeremove .
if
.IR dir\fB/mimereject
exists,
Messages of the Content-Types specified or with MIME parts of these
types will be rejected.
If
.I dir\fB/mimeremove
exists,
.B ezmlm-reject
will reject messages of the Content-Types specified. These content-types will
be accepted as parts of a composite MIME message. They will be
stripped out later by
.BR ezmlm-send(1) .

.B ezmlm-reject
will exit 100 (permanent error) for rejections. If the list address is not in
the message ``To:'' or ``Cc:'' headers and the
.B \-t
switch is active, the exit code is 100 or 99, depending on the
.B \-q
switch (see below).
If you would like to forward messages instead of rejecting them, you can
into the appropriate .qmail file put:

.EX
	|condredirect newaddress except /path/ezmlm-reject DIR
.EE

Now rejected posts will
go to this address, and the recipient can take appropriate action.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
Reject the message if the message body starts ``subscribe''
or ``unsubscribe''. If the
.B \-c
switch is specified, messages will also be rejected if the subject starts
with these words.
.B \-B
(Default.)
Do not reject messages starting ``subscribe'' or ``unsubscribe''.
.TP
.B \-c
(Default.)
Commands are not permitted in the Subject line.
A Subject line consisting solely of HELP, REMOVE, SUBSCRIBE, or UNSUBSCRIBE
is rejected.
.TP
.B \-C
Commands are permitted in the subject line.
.TP
.B \-h
Reject message if any of the headers in
.I dir\fB/headerreject
occur in the header. Mailing-List headers of other mailing list managers
can be put into this file, one per line, to prevent processing of messages
from other mailing lists.
.I dir
must be specified.

A reasonable set of headers would be: ``Mailing-List'', ``X-ml-name'',
\``ml-name'',``X-loop'',``X-listprocessor-version'',``X-mailing-list''. Case
is not important.
.TP
.B \-H
(Default.)
Ignore
.IR dir\fB/headerreject .
.B \-q
Quiet. If the message due to the lack of the list address (see
.BR \-t )
is not accepted, this is logged but no error message is sent to the sender.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet. If a message due to the lack of the list address (see
.BR \-t )
is not accepted,
the message is silently ignored.
.TP
.B \-Q
(Default.)
Not quiet. If a message due to the lack of the list address (see
.BR \-t )
is not accepted,
the sender is notified by an error message.
.TP
.B \-s
(Default.)
A nonempty Subject line is required.
.TP
.B \-S
A Subject line is not required.
.TP
.B \-t
(Default.)
Reject messages that do not have the list address in the ``To:'' or ``Cc:''
header(s).
.B ezmlm-reject
needs access to
.I dir\fB/outhost
and
.I dir\fB/outlocal
to check this. This check is silently omitted if
.I dir
is not specified, to assure backwards compatibility with existing ezmlm lists.
.TP
.B \-T
Do not require the list address in the ``To:'' or ``Cc:'' header(s).
.SH BUGS
.B ezmlm-reject
does not handle rfc822 comments in ``Content-Type:'' lines if present
before the type or boundary.
This could be used to defeat the
MIME rejection function.
OTOH, this function is intended to reduce garbage, not guarantee
its elimination.
