ezmlmrc \- ezmlm-make configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
ezmlmrc
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B ezmlmrc
is a file that configures
.B ezmlm-make(1)
for setting up new lists.
.B ezmlmrc
if a plain text with four types
of tags. All start in
the first position of the line.
No other text is allowed on the same line. For
security reasons, no periods are allowed anywhere in a tag.
Any line with a ``#'' in position 1 is ignored,
as is any text preceding the first tag.

The first line
in
.B ezmlmrc
is unique. It should start in position 1 with ``x.yz'', where
``x'' is the major version number, ``y'' a minor version number, and ``z''
a bugfix version number.
.B ezmlm-make(1)
will print a warning message if it is used with an
.B ezmlmrc
file that lacks the version identifier, or with an
.B ezmlmrc
file that has a version identifier that differs in
either major or minor version numbers from the
.B ezmlm-make
version.

The
.B ezmlmrc
file is processed top down. Text preceding the first tag is ignored.
Subsequently, one and only one file is open for writing. Any text encountered
in
.B ezmlmrc
is copied to that file as is with a few substitutions (see below). Text
following conditional tags is copied only if the condition is met. A file is
automatically closed when a new file is opened. Opening a file overwrites
any preexisting file with that name.
Tags are:

.TP
.B </filename#aI/>
The following text will be copied to
.IR dir\fB/filename
if the options specified after the ``#'' are active, in this case
.I archived
and not
.IR indexed .
Any number of flags can be specified. This is used to adapt the files and
messages to the type of list created. If no flags are
used, the ``#'' can be omitted. If the file name is the same as the previous
tag, or if it is omitted, the text will be added to the previous file.
When a new file is opened the previous file is closed. Attempts to add
more text to a already closed file overwrites its contents.
For all letter switches (except
.BR \-cCvV ),
upper and lower
case tags are opposite and mutually exclusive. Thus, if
.B \-g
is specified,
.B \-G
is not set and
if
.B \-G
is set,
.B -g
is not.

The tag
.B #E
has special meaning. It is false if the list is being edited, e.g.
.B ezmlm-make
.B \-e
or
.BR \+ ,
but true
if switches
.B \-ee
or
.BR \-++
are used, or if
.B ezmlm-make
.I local
is specified. Thus, for normal edits with unchanged list name, the files
tagged with
.B #E
are not overwritten (preserving manual customizations), but if the list name
changes or if explicitly specified by
.B \-ee
or
.BR \-++
the
.B #E
switch is ignored.

.TP
.B </filename#5^i/>
This is an alternative way of specifying ``if switch \-5 is specified and
the \-i switch is not specified''. ``^'' is used as ``not''.
.TP
.B </-filename#eA/>
.IR dir\fB/filename
will be erased, if the options after the ``#'' are active, in this case
.I not archived
and
.IR edit .
An alternative to specify that a flag, e.g. ``4'' should not be active is
to use ``^4''.
.TP
.B </+directory#aI/>
The directory ``directory'' is created if the flags specified are active, in
this case
.I archived
and not
.IR indexed .
If no flags are specified, the ``#'' can be
omitted.
.TP
.B </:link/directory#aI/>
.B dot\fI\-link
is symlinked to
.I dir/directory
if the flags specified are active, in
this case
.I archived
and not
.IR indexed .
If no flags are specified, the ``#'' can be
omitted.
.PP
.I ezmlm-make
substitutes the following tags anywhere within files when they are
(re)created.  Other tags of this format are copied to the files as is.
.TP
.B <#B#>
The path to the
.B ezmlm-idx
binaries.
.TP
.B <#C#>
.I digestcode
.TP
.B <#D#>
.I dir
.TP
.B <#F#>
The alphanumeric flags given to
.I ezmlm-make
concatenated together.
.TP
.B <#H#>
.I host
.TP
.B <#L#>
.I local
.TP
.B <#T#>
.I dot
.TP
.B <#0#>
The argument for
.IR \-0 .
.TP
.B <#1#>
The part of
.I dot
between the first two hyphens (if any).
.TP
.B <#2#>
The part of
.I dot
between the second and third hyphen (if any).
.TP
.BR <#3#> .. <#9#>
The argument to
.IR \-3 .. \-9 .
.PP
Before the template file is processed,
.B ezmlm-make
will create the list directory.
.B ezmlm-make
will also create
.IR dir\fB/key .
.SH "DESCRIPTION OF EZMLMRC"
The ezmlmrc file is preconfigured to act upon
.B ezmlm-make(1)
switches to produce the results as described in the
.B ezmlm-make(1)
man page.
A number of files are created via
.B ezmlmrc
independently of any switches. These are
.I dir\fB/headeradd
adding ``Precedence: bulk'' and ``X-No-Archive: yes'' to outgoing
messages, and
.I dir\fB/headerremove
removing ``Return-Path'', ``Return-Receipt-To'', ``Content-length'', and
``Precedence'' from list messages.  These files are not overwritten when
lists are edited.

.I dir\fB/bouncer
and
.I dir\fB/digest/bouncer
are set up to invoke
.B ezmlm-weed(1)
and
.B ezmlm-return(1)
to handle bounces.
In addition to switch-dependent lines, an invocation of
.B ezmlm-warn(1)
is placed at the end of
.IR dir\fB/editor ,
.IR dir\fB/manager ,
and
.I dir\fB/owner
to process the contents of the bounce directory.
.BR ezmlm-reject(1)
is placed first in
.I dir\fB/editor
(unless the
.B \-0\ mainlist@mainhost
switch is used) to reject undesirable messages.

Below is a description of the switches and the consequences
the have for list creation with the standard
.B ezlmrc
file.
.B emzlm-make(1)
by default sets the
.BR \-a ,
and
.B \-p
switches.
.TP
.B \-a
.I dir\fB/archived
and
.I dir\fB/indexed
are created.
.I dir\fB/text/bottom
is adjusted to mention archive access.
.B \-A
.I dir\fB/archived
and
.I dir\fB/indexed
are removed.
.TP
.B \-b
Block archive.
.I dir\fB/modgetonly
is created to allow only moderators archive access.
.TP
.B \-B
.I dir\fB/modgetonly
is removed.
.TP
.B \-d
.I dir\fB/digested
is created, signalling to programs to send digests.
.TP
.B \-D
.I dir\fB/digested
is removed, signalling to not send digests.
.TP
.B \-f
The text ``[\fIlocal\fR]'' is placed in
.I dir\fB/prefix
resulting in the text being used as the list's subject index.
.TP
.B \-F
.I dir\fB/prefix
is removed.
.TP
.B \-g
.I dir\fB/subgetonly
is created, signalling
.B ezmlm-get(1)
to only allow subscribers to access the archive.
.TP
.B \-G
.I dir\fB/subgetonly
is removed, signalling
.B ezmlm-get(1)
That anyone can access the archive if archive (access) in general is
enabled (see
.B \-p
for ``public'',
.B \-a
for ``archived'', and
.B \-i
for ``indexed''.
.TP
.B \-i
.I dir\fB/threaded
is created to signal
.B ezmlm-archive(1)
to run as appropriate after messages are posted.  This sets up the
cross-reference for
.B ezmlm-cgi(1)
WWW access.
.TP
.B \-I
.I dir\fB/threaded
is removed.
.TP
.B \-j
.I dir\fB/nounsubconfirm
is created to signal
.B ezmlm-manage(1)
to not require confirmation after unsubscription requests.
.TP
.B \-J
.I dir\fB/nounsubconfirm
is removed.
.TP
.B \-l
.I dir\fB/modcanlist
is created to signal
.B ezmlm-manage(1)
to allow retrieval of subscriber list and list log by remote administrators.
.BR NOTE :
This is pointless, unless the list is also set up for remote administration
with the
.B \-r
switch.
.TP
.B \-L
.I dir\fB/modcanlist
is removed, disallowing access to the subscriber list under any
circumstances.
.TP
.B \-m
Message moderation.
.I dir\fB/modpost
is created, which signals
.B ezmlm-store(1)
to store messages and forward confirmation requests to the moderators.
Special action is taken when the
.B \-m
switch is combined with
.BR \-u .
In this case, the handling is as for the
.B \-m
switch alone, but
.I dir\fB/editor
is set up with
.B ezmlm-gate(1)
which will fork
.B ezmlm-send(1)
for posts with an envelope sender that is a subscriber or a moderator, and
for
.B ezmlm-store(1)
for posts with other envelope senders. The consequence is that posts from
subscribers (with the usual caveats for SENDER checks) are posted directly,
whereas other posts are sent for moderation.
.TP
.B \-M
.I dir\fB/modpost
is removed, undoing the changes above.
.TP
.B \-n
Allow text file editing.
.I dir\fB/modcanedit
is created to signal
.ezmlm-manage(1)
to allow remote admins to via E-mail edit the files in
.IR dir\fB/text/ .
.BR NOTE :
This is pointless, unless the list is also set up for remote administration
with the
.B \-r
switch.
.TP
.B \-N
.I dir\fB/modcanedit
is removed to disallow editing of files in
.IR dir\fB/text .
.TP
.B \-o
.I dir\fB/modpostonly
is created to signal
.B ezmlm-store(1)
ro reject posts from non-moderators on moderated lists rather than
sending them for moderation. This is for some announcement lists.
.TP
.B \-O
.I dir\fB/modpostonly
is removed.
.TP
.B \-p
Public.
.I dir\fB/public
is created, signaling
.B ezmlm-get(1)
to allow archive retrieval attempts, and
.B ezmlm-manage(1)
to allow subscription and unsubscription attempts.
.TP
.B \-P
Not public.
.I dir\fB/public
is removed.
.TP
.B \-r
Remote admin.
.I dir\fB/remote
is created to signal
.B ezmlm-manage(1)
to allow remote administration of mailing lists.
.TP
.B \-R
.I dir\fB/remote
is removed.
.TP
.B \-s
Subscription moderation.
.I dir\fB/modsub
is created to signal
.B ezmlm-manage(1)
to forward confirmed subscription requests to the moderators for
approval.  The unsubscription process is unchanged.
.TP
.B \-S
.I dir\fB/modsub
is removed.
.TP
.B \-t
.I dir\fB/addtrailer
is created to signal
.B ezmlm-send(1)
to include the trailer portions in
.I dir\fB/text/trailer
in messages posted to the list.
.TP
.B \-T
.I dir\fB/addtrailer
is removed.
.TP
.B \-u
Subscriber-only posts.
.I dir\fB/subpostonly
is created to allow posts only from subscribers.
.B ezmlm-checksub(1)
is checks the envelope sender against the subscriber address databases.
If the sender is not found, the post is rejected. This results in
subscriber-only posts, with the usual caveats for SENDER checks.
Special action is taken when the
.B \-u
switch is combined with
.BR \-m .
In this case, the setup is as for the
.B \-m
switch alone, but
.B ezmlm-gate(1)
will execute
.B ezmlm-send(1)
for posts with an envelope sender that is a subscriber or a moderator,
and will otherwise moderate the message.  The consequence is that posts
from subscribers (with the usual caveats for SENDER checks) are posted
directly, whereas other posts are sent for moderation.  Also,
.I dir\fB/noreturnposts
is created to silently drop ignored posts rather than returning them to
their senders.
.TP
.B \-U
.I dir\fB/subpostonly is removed.
.TP
.B \-w
.I dir\fB/nowarn
is created to signal
.B ezmlm-warn(1)
to do no work.
.TP
.B \-W
.I dir\fB/nowarn
is removed.
.TP
.B \-x
.I dir\fB/mimeremove 
is created containing many MIME types not routinely supported.
MIME types in
.I dir\fB/mimeremove are stripped from multipart posts before archiving
and distribution.
To view the list of
MIME types, see
.B ezmlmrc
or create a list and view
.IR dir\fB/mimeremove .
In addition
.I dir\fB/msgsize
is created containing ``30000:2'' causing
.B ezmlm-reject(1)
to reject all posts that have a body of less than 2 bytes (empty) or
more than 30000 bytes (too large).
.TP
.B \-y
Confirm postings.
.I dir\fB/confirmpost
is created to signal
.B ezmlm-store(1)
to send a confirmation probe to the sender of each post.
.TP
.B \-Y
.I dir\fB/confirmpost
is removed.
.TP
.B \-0\fI\ mainlist@mainhost
.I dir\fB/sublist
is created with ``mainlist@mainhost''.
.B dir\fB/ezmlm-reject
is not used in
.I dir\fB/editor
to avoid rejecting messages that the main list has accepted.
.TP
.B \-3\fI\ fromarg
The list is set up to add ``from'' to
.I dir\fB/headerremove
and
.B From:\fI fromarg
to
.IR dir\fB/headeradd .
This replaces the incoming ``From:'' header as desirable for some announcement
lists.
.TP
.B \-4\fI\ tstdigopts
.I tstdigopts
will be used as the arguments for
.ezmlm-tstdig(1)
in
.IR dir\fB/editor .
This must be both switches and their arguments for
.BR ezmlm-tstdig(1) .
.BR NOTE :
This is pointless, unless the list is also set up for digests
with the
.B \-d
switch.
.TP
.B \-5\fI\ owner@ownerhost
.I owner@ownerhost is placed in
.I dir\fB/owner
so that mail to ``list-owner'' is forwarded to that address, rather than
being stored in
.IR dir\fB/Mailbox .
If the address does not start with an underscore or alphanumeric character,
the argument must start with an ampersand.
.TP
.B \-6\fI\ plugin:host:port:user:password:datab:table
The string, followed by the list name is placed in
.IR dir\fB/subdb ,
indicating what subscriber database plugin and parameters to use.
.TP
.B \-7\fI\ /msgmodPath
.I msgmodPath
is placed in
.IR dir\fB/modpost
is the list is set up for message moderation with the
.B \-m
switch.
.TP
.B \-8\fI\ /submodPath
.I submodPath
is placed in
.IR dir\fB/modsub
is the list is set up for subscription moderation with the
.B \-s
switch.
.TP
.B \-9\fI\ /remoteAdminPath
.I remoteAdminPath
is placed in
.IR dir\fB/remote
is the list is set up for remote administration with the
.B \-r
switch.
