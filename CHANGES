  digtime were not created.

- Clarified the steps necessary when upgrading in UPGRADE.

ezmlm-idx-7.0.0, 2008-06-16
===========================

This version has three major architectural changes:

1. There is now support for internationalized messages.  All error
messages, all subject lines, and a few other messages are now configured
in a file named "text/messages" that is read at run time.  Messages in
this file will undergo header-style substitution before they are output.

Unlike other text files, all 3 of the files (DIR/text/messages,
/etc/ezmlm/LANG/text/messages, and /etc/ezmlm/default/text/messages) are
read, and only the first match (in the above order) is used for any
given message.  This allows for creation of partial files to override
just select messages.  If no match is found, the internal English text
is used.

2. The use of the "flags" file has been deprecated completely by
individual flag files accessed by the appropriate programs.  This, along
with corresponding changes to the ezmlmrc template, allows for lists to
be reconfigured without invoking ezmlm-make.  To upgrade a list to the
new setup, simply run "ezmlm-make -+ DIR".  Note that this will delete
the "config" and "flags" files, as they have been superceded by other
files.

3. Creation of subscriber tables has been moved out of ezmlm-mktab-* and
into ezmlm-make by adding some additional hooks to the subdb plugins.  A
ezmlm-rmtab program is also added to remove subscriber tables, also with
hooks in the subdb plugins.  The ezmlm-mktab-* programs have been
obsoleted by these changes and have been removed.

Smaller changes:

- Fixed a bug in ezmlm-request that caused a segfault when attempting to
  execute the "which" command.

- Added new program ezmlm-checksub to replace the
	ezmlm-issubn ... || { echo error; exit 100; }
  lines in the ezmlmrc files.  ezmlm-issubn is now deprecated for use in
  .qmail files, but still exists for backwards compatibility.

- Added ezmlm-weed to the confirmer control files.

- Added <#a#> substitution for the local part of the accept address.

- ezmlm-warn will now process bounces for both the main and digest lists
  if neither the -d nor the -D options are given.

- Added several control files for programs:
	dir/digcount		ezmlm-tstdig
	dir/digestcode		ezmlm-get
	dir/digformat		ezmlm-get
	dir/digsize		ezmlm-tstdig
	dir/digtime		ezmlm-tstdig
	dir/modcanedit		ezmlm-manage
	dir/modcanlist		ezmlm-manage
	dir/modgetonly		ezmlm-get
	dir/modpostonly		ezmlm-store
	dir/nosubconfirm	ezmlm-manage
	dir/nounsubconfirm	ezmlm-manage
	dir/nowarn		ezmlm-warn
	dir/subgetonly		ezmlm-get
	dir/noreturnposts	ezmlm-clean

- Removed the ezmlm-make -4 option in favor of the above files.

- Fixed handling of digest bouncer in ezmlm-dispatch.

- Eliminated the use of vfork for portability.

- Added support for decoding sender addresses mangled by SRS.

- Fixed bug when running ezmlm-archive on a newly-created list.

- Always enable ezmlm-request in manager.

- Always enable the "deny" blacklist.

- Fixed a long standing bug in ezmlm-store that caused both posting and
  moderating to happen when both modpost and confirmpost were disabled.

Note: The subdb API was modified in this version.  You will need to
reinstall all sub-* modules along with the main package.  Also, the
messages changes also replaced the confirmpost subject line hack in
ezmlm-store and the mailinglist file.  The contents of DIR/confirmpost
and DIR/mailinglist are now ignored in favor of the SUB_CONFIRM_POST and
TXT_MAILING_LIST messages, respectively.

ezmlm-idx-6.0.1, 2007-10-06
===========================

- Fixed all of the subdb plugins to correct a problem that prevented
  ezmlm-manage from working properly.

- Fixed ezmlm-weed to handle MIME Delivery Status Notification messages
  better.

- Fixed ezmlm-send to insert the proper value for the List-ID: header.
  Thanks Bill Nugent.

- Added the necessary Sender: header to make DomainKeys work into the
  ezmlmrc template.

- ezmlm-mktab-mysql and ezmlm-mktab-pgsql will now only be installed if
  they were built (with "make mysql" or "make pgsql" respectively).

Note: The subdb API was modified in this version.  You will need to
reinstall all sub-* modules along with the main package.

ezmlm-idx-6.0.0, 2006-11-30
===========================

This version introduces two major changes in how ezmlm-idx operates.

First, the naming of subscriber lists has been revamped.  In previous
versions, the subscriber list would be identified by a full path to the
list directory.  In this version, the lists are identified by their
subdirectory name within the list base directory.  Full paths are
supported in some places for backwards compatibility, but only where
they fall within the list directory.  This coincidentally removes the
absolute path requirement in all places except ezmlm-make, and
eliminates the need for (and use of) all the "sql" files not in the list
base directory.

Second, all three subscriber database libraries (standard, MySQL, and
PostgreSQL) have been moved into dynamically loaded plugins.  If you
were previously using MySQL or PgSQL support, please follow the
instructions in UPGRADE.idx.  After this configuration, this version is
backwards configurable with previous versions.

The plugin support also adds support for an optional DIR/subdb file
which supercedes DIR/sql.  The file should contain the subscriber
database plugin name followed by the content that would have gone into
DIR/sql.  If it is not found, DIR/sql is used instead with an assumed
plugin name of "sql".  ezmlm-make will read in and convert DIR/sql if
DIR/subdb does not exist, but it writes out DIR/subdb.

Make sure to read the UPGRADE.idx file for more information on what
steps may be necessary to use this version.

ezmlm-idx-5.1.2, 2007-10-05
===========================

- Fixed ezmlm-send to insert the proper value for the List-ID: header.
  Thanks Bill Nugent.

- Added the necessary Sender: header to make DomainKeys work into the
  ezmlmrc template.

ezmlm-idx-5.1.1, 2006-11-23
===========================

- (Un)subscribe requests initiated and confirmed by a moderator are now
  marked in the Log as "+mod" or "-mod".  This is accomplished by the
  addition of another pair of subscribe/unsubscribe confirmation
  commands ("rc.cookie" and "wc.cookie") to ezmlm-manage to
  differentiate between moderated (un)subscribe requests and
  (un)subscribe requests iniated and confirmed by a moderator.

- Updated the embeded qmail-verh patch to version 0.07

ezmlm-idx-5.1.0, 2006-08-08
===========================

- Added a new configuration files "headerkeep" and "mimekeep" which
  override "headerremove" and "mimeremove" respectively if either of the
  former are present.  Instead of removing bad headers, the "headerkeep"
  file controls which ones *not* to remove.  The "mimekeep" file works
  similarly for MIME parts.

- Added a new program, ezmlm-import, which imports messages from a mbox
  file into ezmlm-idx's message archive.

- Modified ezmlm-gate, ezmlm-issubn, ezmlm-list, ezmlm-sub, and
  ezmlm-unsub to accept relative subscriber database names.  The changes
  take into account backwards compatibility.

- Added ezmlm-weed to both the moderator and manager control files.

- Added several more autoresponder signatures to ezmlm-weed.

- Modified the vfork test to use pid_t instead of int, to fix
  portability issues on Solaris.

- Fixed handling of missing ezmlmrc config file.

- Fixed ezmlm-dispatch to handle working in a non-default .qmail file.

ezmlm-idx-5.0.2, 2006-01-16
===========================

- All programs that copy the input message (ezmlm-get, ezmlm-manage,
  ezmlm-reject, ezmlm-request, and ezmlm-warn) will now copy the whole
  header but only a limited number of lines of the message body,
  configured by putting a number into "copylines".  If this control file
  is not present, no body lines are copied (to avoid spam complaints).

- Fixed ezmlm-make to override settings in the config files with command
  line options instead of the other way around.

- Updated Spanish translation for post-confirm.  Thanks Ruben Cardenal.

- Fixed bug in generation of a (currently unused) email address in the
  subscription confirmation message.

- Substitute <#c#> in (un)subscribe confirm messages with just the
  confirmation cookie (ie <#r#> without the <#l#>- prefix).

ezmlm-idx-5.0.1, 2005-12-16
===========================

- If files cannot be found in either the list directory or the
  language-specific directory, try to pull them from the default
  directory (/etc/ezmlm/default).

- Added a proper charset for Japanese texts.

- Added a Spanish translation for post-confirm.  Thanks Ruben Cardenal.

- Fixed a bug in ezmlm-cgi caused by the use of "char" type for array
  index calculations.

- Fixed ezmlm-gate failing to exit 0 on success.  Thanks Ian Charnas and
  Sami Farin.

ezmlm-idx-5.0.0, 2005-10-03
===========================

- Moved all the language-specific files (that is, all the "text" files
  plus "charset" and "mailinglist") out of the ezmlmrc files into
  individual files installed in a common location (/etc/ezmlm/LANG by
  default).

- Modified the programs to try to pull files that are not present in the
  list directory from the common location above.

- Replaced the use of the "config" file in ezmlm-make with individual
  files containing one setting each.  ezmlm-make will still read the
  config file for now, but it is considered depricated.  Running
  "ezmlm-make -+" on an existing list will upgrade it.

- Added a "conf-etc" config file to allow changing the path to
  configuration files (defaults to "/etc/ezmlm").

- Added a "conf-lang" config file to replace the "make ISO" mechanism.

- Modified the "copy" function, which translates from "text" files into
  output emails, to also select sections at run time based on the list's
  configured flags.

ezmlm-idx-0.444, 20061123
=========================

- Fixed text files to not overwrite the "text/top" and "text/bottom"
  files unconditionally.  Also rewrote places where the filename was
  duplicated in the tags.

- (Un)subscribe requests initiated and confirmed by a moderator are now
  marked in the Log as "+mod" or "-mod".  This is accomplished by the
  addition of another pair of subscribe/unsubscribe confirmation
  commands ("rc.cookie" and "wc.cookie") to ezmlm-manage to
  differentiate between moderated (un)subscribe requests and
  (un)subscribe requests iniated and confirmed by a moderator.

ezmlm-idx-0.443, 2005-09-01
===========================

- Fixed the marker logic in ezmlm-moderate to allow comments between any
  two lines containing "%%%", not just lines 8 characters or longer.

- Some internal changes in ezmlm-test and the subdb API.

ezmlm-idx-0.442, 2005-07-12
===========================

-Added a "sql" file in the "LIST/mod" directory on creation of lists.
 This fixes a long-standing bug where moderator addresses are not stored
 in SQL.

 NOTE: Running ezmlm-make -e or -+ on a moderated list that has SQL
 enabled will cause moderation to fail due to the moderator subscriber
 list now being accessed in SQL.  You will need to run the following
 command:

	ezmlm-list -M $DIR/mod | ezmlm-sub $DIR/mod

-Fixed bug in pgsql searchlog query.

-Fixed bug in ezmlm-request handling of multi-line subjects.

ezmlm-idx-0.441, 2005-07-04
===========================
-Fixed critical one-off bug in both *SQL configuration parsers.
 Thanks Jim Winstead.
-Fixed lack of quoting in PgSQL subscribe code.  Thanks Dan O'Neill.
-Updated ezmlm-cgi to generate valid XHTML/CSS output.
 Thanks Brian Ghidinelli
-Fixed readwrite.h to work on LP64 systems.  Thanks Amitai Schlair
-Don't clobber msgsize file on re-make.  Thanks Stephen Quinney.
-ezmlm-test can now be run by any user, in any writeable directory.
-Put a valid recipient into the To: header in moderation messages.

ezmlm-idx-0.440, 2005-04-15
===========================
-Wrote a script to automatically generate the Makefile and TARGETS.
-Fixed a problem with handling text files with no final newline.
-Added a new program, ezmlm-dispatch, to be run from a global
 .qmail-default file
-Removed support for qmail older than version 1.02.
-Removed all references to "inhost" and "inlocal" which were completely
 unused but still referenced in documentation and tests.

ezmlm-idx-0.435, 2005-03-08
===========================
-Fixed string realocation bug in ezmlm-manage.  Thanks Tom Moertel.
-Tweaked the subscriber log search subject to differentiate it from the
 complete subscriber log.

ezmlm-idx-0.434, 2005-02-07
===========================
-Replaced the generic "ezmlm response" subject with unique subjects.
-Fixed failure to build/link ezmlm-mktab in the Makefile.
-Fixed a typo in the ezmlm-manage man page.  Thanks Charles Cazabon.
-Updated the pt_BR language texts.  Thanks Glen Stewart.
-Fixed broken invocation of ezmlm-confirm in ezmlmrc.  Thanks SATOH
 Fumiyasu.
-Fixed ezmlmrc template problem with moderated lists.
-Fixed a deadlock between ezmlm-confirm and ezmlm-store.

ezmlm-idx-0.433, 2005-01-09
===========================
-Fixed a problem in passing options to ezmlm-send in ezmlm-confirm,
 ezmlm-moderate, and ezmlm-store.  Thanks Ueli Heuer.
-Fixed the Japanese language code from "jp" to "ja" as per ISO 639.

ezmlm-idx-0.432, 2005-01-01
===========================
-Un-fixed the Swedish and Danish translation names, as they should match
 ISO 639 language codes, not ISO 3166 country codes.

ezmlm-idx-0.431, 2004-12-29
===========================
-Make ezmlm-idx obey $QMAILQUEUE.
-Added missing ezmlm-confirm.0 target.
-Auto-generate all version strings from the VERSION file.
-Fixed up the broken Swedish translation.  Thanks Mads E. Eilertsen.
-Fixed naming of translations to match their ISO 3166 country codes:
 sv => se (Sweden) and da => dk (Denmark)
-Internal reorganization of ezmlm-test
-Internal reorganization of email header generation.

ezmlm-idx-0.43, 2004-11-25
==========================
-Added per-post sender confirmation patch from Tullio Andreatta.
 See the documentation for ezmlm-make -y for details.
-Changed all example domain names in text files to the RFC 2606 mandated
 example.com domain name.
-Several documentation and comment fixes.  Thanks Tullio Andreatta.
-Added conf-sub control file, used to choose which subscriber
 mechanism to use.  This replaces the "make std/mysql/pgsql" mechanism.
 Adapted from patch by Tullio Andreatta.
-Got rid of the frivolous uses of /bin/sh to exec ezmlm-send.
-Always reject bounce messages in ezmlm-reject.
-Substitute <#r#> in (un)subscribe confirm messages with just the local
part of the reply address (for web-based confirmation).

ezmlm-idx-0.421, 2004-06-02
===========================
-Updated ezmlmrc.fr.  Thanks Jean-Marc Lasgouttes.
-Fixed bug in ezmlm-request when dealing with continuation lines.
 Thanks Sami Farin.
-Replaced many library with public-domain sources.
-Fixed "log" function conflicting with built-in math function.
-Fixed problem with "test -e" in makelang.sh for Solaris.
-Fixed typo bug in ezmlm-cron.
-Fixed uses of "head -#" and "tail -#" to "head -n #" and "tail -n #".

ezmlm-idx-0.42, 2004-01-14 (New maintainer: Bruce Guenter <bruceg@em.ca>)
=========================================================================
-The ezmlmrc.* files were broken into two parts, to make them easier to
 write and maintain.  The language specific parts are stored in the
 "lang" subdirectory.
-Updated ezmlm-cgi to version 1.18, which includes the no banner
 security fix.
-Added ezmlmrc.hu.  Thanks Julian Severn-nek http://js.hu/
-Added ezmlmrc.nl.  Thanks Willem
-Fixed problem in ezmlm-send munging MIME attachments using implicit
 content types.  Thanks Ed
-Fixed typo in ezmlm-unsub -- manual unsubscriptions would be
 erroneously logged as "+manual"
-Fixed ezmlm-gate to handle the -Q option.  Thanks Bjoern Hansen.
-Fixed internal bug calling decodeHDR.
-Fix ezmlm-manage to properly send subscription confirmation to
moderators.  Thanks Mate Wierdl.
-Portability and bug fixes to ezmlm-test.
-Added a "dry-run" option to ezmlm-gate.
-Fixed ezmlm-send to fully handle QMQP relaying.  Thanks Bernhard Graf.
-Fixed ezmlm-gate to use "/bin/sh" consistently.  Thanks Bernhard Graf.
-Fixed ezmlm-cgi's output of non-standard port numbers.
-Fixed message archiving in subscribe-only moderated lists.

ezmlm-idx-0.40, 1999-12-20
==========================
-Fixed bug in sub_mysql/issub.c that caused return of undef pointer for
 non-subs. Security problem for sender checks, but not for moderation. Of
 course only mysql version affected.
-Updated ezmlmrc translations. Thanks all who worked on this.
-added ezmlmrc.es. Thanks Vicent Mas/Francesc Alted/Sonia Lorente/Cyndy DePoy.
-added ezmlmrc.cn_GB. Thanks HG.
-ezmlm-weed: Groupwise garbage filter added. Thanks, SA.
-mysql: include files now don't have a dir. This is so that one can have
 them in e.g. /usr/include. conf-sqlcc adjusted.
-Removed utils/. Not updated - add when done.
-Full PostgresSQL support. Thanks, MS.
-Corrected ordering of searchlog output for MySQL version to match default.
 Thanks, MS.
-ezmlm-moderate/store: Fork /bin/sh ... instead of sh for people with unset
 PATH. Thanks, TM.
-ezmlm-manage: rfc2369 headers added where possible also to admin
 messages. Main finesse is that the WELCOME message has a custom
 List-Unsubscribe header. -U/-S logic deconvoluted. -nN added.
-ezmlm-store: -B to send only header of message to moderate, rather than
 the entire message. Used for send-only list with very large posts.
-ezmlm-reject: -b to reject messages with body or subject starting with
 ``subscribe'' or ``unsubscribe''.
-support for List-ID (draft). Added to all list messages if DIR/listid is
 present. The first line of that file is added after "List-ID: ".
-ezmlmrc: Added List-Subscribe header. Rewrite some texts, move some info
 from bottom to help. Add ezmlm-archive (-i), add some switches to make
 announcement lists easier.
-ezmlm-make: Modifed to make -I default since -i now controls ezmlm-archive
 with all lists configured with ezmlm-get. Also, ezmlm-make will not overwrite
 files tagged with #E in ezmlmrc when in edit mode (-+ or -e). This preserves
 manual customization. The behavior can be overridden with -++ or -ee to
 reset the list texts (old behavior). Added version check for ezmlmrc Tx, SA.
-ezmlm-archive and ezmlm-cgi added: Very easy to set up WWW access to list
 archive. Support for various charsets incl iso-2022-*. For Russian,
 one would need to do substitutions when making entries in archive/n/index.
 This is not supported yet, so summary view entries may be incorrect if
 the messages use Russian text in a charset different from the one the list
 uses. Probably doesn't work for Chinese - lack of willing/able testers.
-qmail-qmqp support via idx.h and DIR/qmqpservers. If your bandwidth is
 limited, look at this (see ezmlm-send(1)/ezmlm-get(1)/ezmlm(5)). If you
 have large lists, sublist them locally and specify different QMQP servers
 for each sublist via DIR/qmqpservers. Added qmail-qmqpc.tar.gz patch to
 allow specifying QMQP server on command line. With this, DIR/qmqpservers can
 be used to specify different servers for different lists for busy servers.
-ezmlm-gate: added -q file. Each line in "file" is processed as per
 dot-qmail(5). 111 => temp_err, 99 => post, 100 => moderate, 0 => check sub.
 Any other exit code will result in a bounce.
 NOTE: This changes the behavior of ezmlm-gate used with only one DIR
 argument (not used in any std listsetup for previous versions). Before,
 this tested for subscriber status, now messages will
 be moderated. This use is not set up by any ezmlm-make option and should
 be _extremely_ rate. To obtain the old behavior, simply specify the
 list directory twice.
-Made conf-sqlcc and conf-sqlld to support both phases of the build. Adjusted
 mysql includes to not assume they're in a "mysql" subdir.
 

ezmlm-idx-0.324, 1999-09-05 (PostgresSQL)
=========================================
-Minor typo in ezmlmrc.fr fixed.
-Added [partial] PostgresSQL interface by Magnus Stalaker. See INSTALL.idx.
-Added ezmlm-store Cc: docs mistakenly missed in 0.323.
-Fixed problem with "it/itall" target (Thanks MW).


ezmlm-idx-0.323, 1999-08-15 (bug fix)
=====================================
-ezmlm-store: Cc: list-accept-subscribe remote admin conf added to mod
 requests. For lists using ezmlm-gate, this allows adding poster as allowed
 alias. Thanks RVI for suggesting.
-Added qmail-verh.tar.gz (0.03). This is the 0.02 qmail patch and a patch
 to change ezmlmrc to take advantage of it. See docs inside.
-conf-sqlcc/conf-sqlld instead of conf-sql to allow include file additions
 (conf-cc) and libraries (conf-ld) for RDBMS interfaces.
-Added ezmlmrc.id and ezmlmrc.it. Thanks APN and RDC.
-ezmlm-manage: Mime boundary was missing for subscribe notifications for
 moderated lists using QP/base64 encoding. Thanks TF.
-ezmlm-get: Logic to prevent digest triggering from list-@host.
-ezmlm-get: Digest parts have file names list_msgnum.txt instead of
 list.msgnum to work around a MS Outlook bug. Thanks, MH.
-ezmlm-request: Support for multipart MIME when used as a majordomo emulator.
 Thanks, Johannes Ehrfeldt for reporting the bug.
-ezmlm-send: trailer was added to mutipart/non-alternative. Problems with
 multipart/signed. Now, trailer for multipart is added only to mixed,
 digest, and parallel. Thanks BPF.
-ezmlm-reject.1: typo.
-ezmlm-test.sh multiple minor changes to work on more platforms. Still, if
 it doesn't work, the problem is most likely here, and not in ezmlm(idx)
 itself. Thanks RM DM and others.
-ezmlm-moderate: added missing newline at beginning of MIME reject message.
 Thanks, XXX.
-idx.h fixed ALT_XX alternative command names which erroneously started '-'.
 Looks bad, but was of no consequence.


ezmlm-idx-0.322, 1999-05-05 (bug fix)
=====================================
-ezmlmrc.*: Added x-confirm-reading-to and x-pmrqc. Thanks JK.
-ezmlmrc.ru: Added Russian version contributed by RVI. Thanks.
-ezmlmrc: Czech version of ezmlmrc is ezmlmrc.cz. Should be ezmlmrc.cs. Fixed.
-searchlog.c: Made the MySQL version also match in address field to make
 the records returned the same as for std version.
-ezmlm-store: -allow-subscribe confirm address in Cc: header to make it easier
 for the moderator to add the poster to the allow database. (Thanks, RVI.)
-ezmlm-manage: -query from remote admin for subscriber failed due to use of
 static storage within issub(). Fixed.
-ezmlm-manage: Made remote admin unsub failure return error. For sub it's
 important to be silent for multi-moderator setups, but since unsub is never
 moderated, it's ok to return negative feedback, since it may be needed by
 remote admins. As a consequence it was trivial to add -Q[Q] not quiet to
 provide [un]subscribe feedback to the owner.
-ezmlm-send/reject: "boundary" in Content-type can be delimited by ';'.
 Without, some messages could be erroneously rejected when using mimeremove.
 New error text added to errtxt.h.


ezmlm-idx-0.321, 1999-03-22 (bug fix)
=====================================
-added ezmlm-limit to limit list traffic. As this is a bug fix release,
 ezmlm-limit should be considered experimental and is not built/installed
 by default. (Thanks, TM for suggesting.)
-subscribe.c: in some cases a ``T'' was incorrectly added before the address
 in the DIR/Log subscription log. Corrected (Thanks, PH.).
-ezmlm-test: reordered some tests to avoid timing problems on some
 platforms. Tested hostname output since it may return a non-FQDN host name.
 Added tests for most of the fixed bugs.
-ezmlm-tstdig: improved DEFAULT logic. Failed with existing incorrect inlocal
 in virtual domains.
-ezmlm-manage bug: deny access control fixed.
-ezmlm-request/ezmlm-tstdig: qmail>=1.02 doesn't set DEFAULT when there is
 nothing matching. Unable to detect qmail version here. Changed logic to
 always be correct with qmail>=1.02 and virtually always for earlier versions.
 Missing inlocal is taken as meaning qmail>=1.02.
-ezmlm-request: mdomo emulator: Corrected address listed for WHICH.
-ezmlm-request: Silent exit on bounces (NULL sender). Fake SENDER spam to the
 majordomo address otherwise causes double bounces to postmaster who has
 better things to do.
-ezmlmrc: corrected missing ezmlm-return in bouncer for normal (^6W) lists.
 (Thanks Matt McGlynn.)
-opensql.c: psql needs to be destroyed for ezmlm-reqest WHICH which may open
 connections to several servers.
-searchlog.c: made inbuf/ssin static. Was incorrect and generated linker
 warning on some systems, but had no functional consequences. Thanks, SOH.
-ezmlm-test: converted "export ENVIRON=value" to "ENVIRON=value; export ENVIRON"
 to work with Solaris sh. Also, moved final ezmlm-warn section to the end
 to avoid timing issue on some systems. "ps" test for qmail made non-fatal,
 as differing options on different ps make it more likely that ps use is
 the problem than that qmail is not running. (Thanks, SOH.)


ezmlm-idx-0.32, 1999-02-22
==========================
-updated ezmlm-test. It tests most functions, and for important new features
 or bugs discovered we'll add new tests in future. Thanks ME for patient
 testing, suggestions, and "de-bashing".
-added a rfc2369 headers for list-help, list-post, and list-unsubscribe.
 It takes little space, and may promote support in MUAs.
-ezmlm-get: list-get.9999999_x now always returns at least HISTGET messages
 (default 30) provided that "9999999" is larger that the latest message number.
 This allows embedding of an address for new subscribers to get at least what
 has transpired since the latest digest and usually 30 messages before that,
 to quickly see what's going on.
-ezmlm-get: list-get for non-digested lists now returns the latest HISTGET
 (default 30) messages instead of the latest message. To get the latest message,
 mail list-get-9999999, where "9999999" is larger than the latest message
 number.
-Added ezmlm-manage/get -B switch to suppress text/bottom + request addition to
 ezmlm-manage messages (except of course -help).
-ezmlm-send uses copy() for trailer and headeradd. <#h#>, <#l#>, and <#n#>
 in these texts are substituted with outhost, outlocal, and message number,
 respectively. Now you can add ``To receive this thread, mail
 <#l#>-get.<#n#>@<#h#>'' to the trailer. Removed dir/sequence feature, since
 this can now be done with headeradd. copy() modified to suppress blank
 lines when copying headers. extern decl in copy.h fixed. A consequence
 is that headeradd isn't added to the archive copy which is good. <#n#>
 for ezmlm-get is the latest message processed, except for the digest, where
 it is the first message in the digest (which is also the digest msg #).
-Added ezmlm-split (previously separate). Modified to use the same split
 mechanisms as the SQL routines. -D switch to support easier reorganisation,
 with extensive docs in man page. Interconversion between ezmlm-split and SQL
 use is now relatively easy.
-Reorganized files. The subscriber db sources are now in sub_std/ for the
 standard ezmlm db, sub_mysql/ for the mysql version. Normally, there are
 symlinks to the std version. ``make mysql'' changes the symlinks to sub_mysql
 and ``make std'' can be used to set them back.
-Replaced ezmlm-glmake with ``ezmlm-make -Cezmlmglrc''. See ezmlmglrc.5.
-Added status.pl for status monitoring of ``list trees'' via httpd. In utils/.
-Added feedback logging support with ezmlm-receipt and ezmlm-make -w. ezmlm-send
 and ezmlm-get for the SQL version log info to the db.
-Added support for setting up a minimal (SQL-enabled) sublist:
 ezmlm-make -Cezmlmsubrc. See ezmlmsubrc.5.
-Added ezmlm-make -w to remove ezmlm-warn invocation and if used with -6 to
 configure ezmlm-receipt in place of ezmlm-return. Used for main list in
 SQL-enabled list clusters for feedback and bounce logging.
-Added MySQL support. ezmlm-make -6. This is a _major_ change and makes it
 trivial to do sublisting and dynamically redistribute load. see ezmlm.5.
-Modified ezmlm-return to add -dD switches. Previous design decision to have
 ezmlm-return autodetect digest vs normal bounces cause problems when
 sublisting a digest list. -dD force non-digest vs digest function and we'll
 set uyp new lists with that, but keep autodetection for compatibility with
 existing lists. ezmlmrc files modified appropriately. German version
 updated and improved by Frank Tegtmeyer. Thanks!
-Modified ezmlm-warn/return bounce handling. DIR/bounce now has a ``h''
 subdir, further subdivided a-p for storage of h... files, where the first
 character of the hash is used for the subdir, and a ``d'' subdir, containing
 subdirs, each holding bounce (d... files) for a 10,000 s interval. This way,
 only ``ripe'' bounce files are processed by ezmlm-warn. Also, ``lastd'' to
 prevent unnecessary reparsing of bounces and ``lasth'' to keep track for
 ``h'' subdir cleaning of remaining files older than 3x time out.
-Modified all programs to use DEFAULT if available. With qmail>=1.02, this
 allows one to ignore inhost/inlocal so that special adjustment for virtual
 domain lists is no longer required. Works the old way with qmail<1.02.
-DIR/extra and DIR/blacklist for extra allowed SENDERs and SENDER blacklisting
 have been renamed DIR/allow and DIR/deny. This is used sparingly and the old
 nomenclature was confusing. ``mkdir DIR/allow; mv DIR/extra/* DIR/allow''
 and the corresponding move for DIR/deny will take care of it.
-Extended the remote admin -log command. Now, -log.xxx will return only
 Log lines matching 'xxx'. '.' matches '.' and '_' matches any character.
-The ``From:'' line of subscribers confirmation message will be logged to
 ``Log''. This allows the administrator to use the Log to by name locate the
 subscription address of a user.


ezmlm-idx-0.316, 1999-08-15 (bug fixes only)
============================================
-Migrated back fixes for 0.322 -> 0.323 that are applicable to 0.31x:
-ezmlm-get: Made filename extension constant for digest parts to work around
 Outlook bug.
-ezmlm-manage: Mime boundary added for mod-sub-ok message when QP/base64 is
 used.
-ezmlm-manage.1: Typo.
-ezmlm-moderate: Missing newline for non-MIME reject message.
-ezmlm-request: Support by global interface of multipart/alternative messages.
-ezmlm-send: Trailer only for some types of multipart messages.
-ezmlm-reject.1: Typo.


ezmlm-idx-0.315, 1999-05-05 (bug fixes only)
============================================
-Bug fixes fed back from up to 0.322.
-ezmlm-send/reject: "boundary" in Content-type can be delimited by ';'.
 Without, some messages could be erroneously rejected when using mimeremove.
 New error text added to errtxt.h.
-ezmlm-manage: -query from remote admin for subscriber failed due to use of
 static storage within issub(). Fixed.
-ezmlm-manage bug: deny access control fixed.


ezmlm-idx-0.314, 1999-02-16 (bug fixes only)
============================================
-Added ezmlm-test, a script that tests [most] ezmlm + idx program functions.
-added ezmlmrc.cz (Thanks, Jan Kasprzak).
-ezmlm-make -e failed if DIR/config didn't exist. Fixed. (Thanks, SOH.)
-ezmlm-make man page bug for virtual domain (Thanks, XX).
-ezmlm-get segfaulted when run from the command line with LOCAL undefined.
 Fixed. (Thanks, ME.)

ezmlm-idx-0.313, 1998-11-21 (bug fixes almost only)
===================================================
-ezmlm-get returns 0 for success in editor and command line use, rather than
 99. No impact on current lists, but makes more sense.
-ezmlm-warn tests >= for timeout rather than >. No impact other than easier
 use with future test script.
-ezmlm-manage -get function was broken - fixed. Needed for backwards compat
 with ezmlm-0.53. (Thanks, KS.)
-Reorganized INSTALL.idx, UPGRADE.idx, README.idx and introduced FILES.idx
 to simplify. Made corrections to FAQ.idx, but no additions.
-ezmlm-send no longer adds trailer to multipart/mixed messages. Also, multipart
 messages consisting of only "mimeremove" parts will be bounced. (Thanks, BE.)
 The trailer is suppressed for base64-encoded messages. In both cases,
 trailer addition might corrupt the message. Default charset is added if none
 specified (was left empty).
-The US version of ezmlmrc is now ``ezmlmrc.en_US'' and ``make'' by default
 copies it to ezmlmrc. Added support to Makefile and docs to copy in other
 versions via e.g. ``make jp''. Target ezmlmrc is there to not overwrite with
 ezmlmrc.en_US on ``make setup''.
-Changed ezmlmrc so that headeradd/headerremove/sub-ok/mod-sub are not rewritten
 when editing lists. (Thanks, GS.)
-In ezmlm-idx and ezmlm-send, made dirs without trailing slash (mkdir with
 it bombs on Ultrix). (Thanks, BW.)
-added check for NULL sender is zapnosub() in ezmlm-get. Fixed NULL pointer
 use when the command is -dig- and no digest code was given on the command
 line.
-added 'x' to FORMATS in idx.h. (Thanks, MMcL.)
-ezmlm-reject changed to honor subject continuation lines. Eudora likes to
 break right after "Subject:" which caused rejection for empty subject.
 (Thanks, SOH.) Same for To:. Also deals with quoted content types. Error
 message now always states the offending MIME type.
-Added "(null)", "(none)", and "(no subject)" to rejected subjects. What are
 these MUA authors thinking??
-ezmlm-reject bug fixed to reject commands in subjects. (Thanks, JH.)
-ezmlm-request bug fixed to allow correct processing of complete command
 addresses in the subject, even for virtual domains. (Thanks, EC.)
-ezmlmrc.de corrected (Thanks, FT).
-Made local check in ezmlm-tstdig case-insensitive (Thanks, Rick Myers).
-Fixed ezmlm-glconf to work with 'sh', not only 'bash' (missing ';' before '}')
 (Thanks, MS).
-ezmlm-manage: text/bottom added also when moderated subscription is
 completed (Thanks, SOH). Added -log command to ezmlm-manage. Allows remote
 admins to retrieve Log if -l switch is set. Added -log into to mod-help via
 ezmlmrc.
-Made character defines sun4 cc compliant in decode{Q|B}.c and unfoldHDR.c.
-Added support for "Sv:" and "Rv:" reply indicators (Nordic, Spanish).
-Improved/expanded ezmlm-check.
-Added -+ switch to ezmlm-make. Makes letter switches sticky (not -cC).
 <#F#> is all letter switches, not only the ones set. (Thanks, SOH). Also,
 added virtual domain info to ezmlm-make.1.

ezmlm-idx-0.312, 1998-08-05 (bug fixes only and support scripts added)
======================================================================
-Fixed declaration of char16table[] in decodeQ.c to get clean mips64 compile
 (Thanks, MF).
-Fixed ezmlm-request so that <#l#> and <#h#> are substituted correctly.
-Added ezmlm-glmake to create a global list setup. Left ezdomo.tar.gz since that
 is what's documented in the FAQ.
-Fixed inconsistencies/errors in the ezdomo.tar.gz example files (Thanks, PN).
-Changed ezmlm-return.c to understand qmail preVERP error messages even if
 qmail is patched to use MIME error messages.
-Added ezmlm-glconf and man page to the package. The program creates a config
 file for the "majordomo-style" interface from a user's existing lists.
-Updated ezmlmrc and translations to not overwrite text/faq|info when editing
 the list and add a note on -faq/-info to text/bottom and on -list/-edit
 to text/mod-help. Thanks to the "usual suspects" for the translations!
-Corrected small bug in ezmlmrc.de and ezmlmrc.da.
-Corrected small bug in ezmlm-check -s switch handling (Thanks, DS).
-Fixed bug in unfoldHDR.c affecting handling of subject prefixes without
 message number (Thanks, LL).

ezmlm-idx-0.311, 1998-07-01 (bug fix only)
==========================================
-Restored the mistakenly amputated ezmlmrc (English only, others were ok).
-Fixed ezmlm-gate to tolerate unset $SENDER (Thanks, AP).

ezmlm-idx-0.31, 1998-06-30
==========================
-Added ezmlm-manage -m switch for moderated unsubscription, pre request.
 (Thanks, FT).
-made cookie for accept/reject the same: ezmlm-moderate/ezmlm-store.
-ezmlmrc.da (Thanks, TF). Other ezmlmrc updated (Thanks: see README.idx).
-copy.c modified to allow NUL, multiple tags per line, and <#h#> => outhost.
 (Thanks, TM).
-ezmlm-manage sends replies to "-help" from "list-return-@". This will break
 all autoresponder loops for admin messages after 1 round. Otherwise,
 ezmlm-warn and a broken responder can start an endless manage<->responder
 exchange. (Thanks, MM.)
-Simplified tosubs(). Slightly less efficient with qmail, but avoids a lot
 of problems.
-Added umask(022) to ezmlm-unsub.c and ezmlm-sub.c, in case they 
 are the ones to create dir/lock.
-ezmlm-moderate and ezmlm-gate changed to pass on switches for exec'd
 programs. ezmlm-moderate sets sender for ezmlm-send so that -C switch
 works also for moderated lists.
-ezmlm-accept now autoconfigured with ezmlm bin path and installed.
-ezmlm-manage allows remote access to the ``extra'' db (-allow-subscribe)
 with same restrictions as for the main list. Access to the ``blacklist''
 db for remote admins only (-deny-subscribe).
-ezmlmrc changed to skip ezmlm-reject in editor of sublists.
-ezmlm-reject now rejects messages that do not contain the list
 address in To:/Cc: (Thanks, DJB). ezmlmrc modified, since it requires
 the ezmlm-reject line to have the list dir on the command line. Not full
 rfc822 parser (see BUGS in ezmlm-reject.1!).
-made missing file in copy.c a permanent error. This way, it's discovered
 sooner, as the list owner may not have access to maillog.
-docs updates, including adding terminal '/' to directories to make them
 clearly distinct from files.
-Safer storage of return-path by ezmlm-store.
-ezmlm-send now adds a "Return-Path:" header to the archive copy. This way,
 listowners without maillog access can get all the info (together with
 "received:" and "delivered-to: lines).
-ezmlm-send -R switch to remove "Received:" headers that cause bounces to users
 (due to too low sendmail hopcount) that can subscribe and are reached by
 probes just fine. "received:" headers still go to the archive (Thanks, TM).
-Fixed minor bug in "reply-indicator" trimming (unfoldHDR.c).
-Make default behavior of -get command to send the messages that have arrived
 since the last digest (up to MAXGET) if there has ever been a digest (only
 last message otherwise).
-"prefix" number substitution changed to LAST '#'. Support for rfc2047 encoded
 prefix. With iso-2022-* this will work only if characters after '#' are
 ascii only, due to the removal of redundant ESC sequences from subjects before
 comparison, and the need for any line to end in ascii. Improved robustness
 of unfoldHDR.c (could be crashed with some illegal encoded words).
-Make reject messages come From: list-owner@listhost in ezmlm-moderate. A
 "Reply-To: address" is added if "-t address" is on the command
  line (Thanks, YG).
-ezmlm-get digesting now orders headers only for rfc1153 (mandated), otherwise
 displays them as they come. The default headers included are the same, but
 this can be overridden with dir/digheaders containing a list of the headers
 to include.
-ezmlm-request takes the first line starting with a letter and interprets it
 as a command, if the subject is empty or does not start with a letter.
 Only one line is interpreted.
-ezmlm-request if used with "-f config" interprets "config" as a config file
 of lists and list info. When used with this switch, it ignores the subject and
 expects a command on the first body line. This is to service e.g. the
 majordomo@host address. See man page.
-ezmlm-request understands a number of command synonyms to make it easier for
 users familiar to other MLMs. These are just translated into regular ezmlm
 commands for use with the list.
-ezmlm-manage services -faq, -info, and -query commands (see man page). Stubs
for faq/info added to ezmlmrc and to edit-list via ezmlmrc.
-ezmlm-check fixes for grep not understanding '-q' and a ezmlm-check -S switch
 to avoid subscriber listing (Thanks, TEE).

ezmlm-idx-0.302, 1998-06-17 (bug fixes only)
============================================
-Removed args from copy_insertsubject() call in ezmlm-send.c
-made ezmlm-make enforce absolute "dot".
-Fixed MIME newline bug in ezmlm-moderate/store/clean. (Thanks, JS).
-Fixed missing arg in postmsg() call from previous fix (Thanks, MF).

ezmlm-idx-0.301, 1998-05-08 (bug fixes only)
============================================
-Digest format is multipart/digest again. The new format MIXED/'x' is
 identical, except that it is multipart/mixed. The former works well for
 most MUA. The latter is better for Pine when ezmlm texts are content-
 transfer-encoded.
-RFC1153 format ignores content-transfer-encoding. This works fine with
 us-ascii. For non-us-ascii it works if the mail path is 8-bit clean. RFC1153
 is really a us-ascii format, since the messages are dependent on the
 encoding of the main message. This way is as good as it can get.
-Added many content-types to mimeremove in ezmlmrc (Thanks, SP).
-Removed most of the -x stuff in ezmlmrc. Now, -x only adds MIME content-type
 stripping (extensive) and limits message body size to 2-40000 bytes. If you
 want "Reply-To:" munging, edit ezmlmrc. The "mailto:" stuff was bad, and 
 the references to list-owner@host for intractable problems are now standard.
-Changed ezmlmrc extensions to iso 639: SV - Swedish.
-Added ezmlmrc files for DE, PL (Thanks, FT, SP).
-Fixed ezmlm-get: -index reply lacked MIME end boundary (Thanks, KI).
-Fixed bug in ezmlm-get: outformat error when using digest trigger messages
 in dir/editor. (Thanks YG).
-Fixed bug in ezmlm-clean: cp_setlocal wasn't called.
-Improved ezmlmrc files so that digest links and dirs are not created for
 on-digested lists. Decreases number of .qmail files.
-Fixed bug in ezmlm-get: Headers from trigger message are no longer copied
 to digest (but are still copied to -index/-get/-thread reply). (Thanks STH.)
-Fixed ezmlm-0.53 bug in ezmlm-return. The "d..." file was the same for all
 addresses of a pre-VERP bounce, resulting in only the first one being
 processed correctly (sent to DJB).
-Changed ezmlm-get to include dir/headeradd headers for digest. (Thanks PH.)
-Changed ezmlm-get to send digest "To: list@list" from "list-digest@host".
 This way, the list address is one of the "reply-to-all" addresses, just
 as for list messages. (Thanks PH.)
-Corrected ezmlmrc: in some places "d" was used for "n" switch resuling in
 missing dir/text files for editing if editing was enabled and digest
 were not. (Thanks JS.)
-Corrected ezmlmrc/se/jp to add terminal ';' to list in ezmlm-issubn
 lines. Caused trouble with strict /bin/sh as on FreeBSD. (Thanks STH.)
-Corrected ezmlm-make man page to show that "digestcode" is optional.


ezmlm-idx-0.30, 1998-03-25
==========================
-Fixed bug in continuation line handling for digest. In some circumstances,
 continuations ended up with the wrong header. (Thanks SA).
-Changed digest format to multipart/mixed as pine has trouble with an
 encoded text/plain part first in multipart/digest (although this is
 rfc2046-ok). (Thanks SA).
-Updated FAQ, *.idx, and man pages for new functionality.
-Changed subdb.a folding qputsubs.c into putsubs.c and passing a pointer
 to the write function. Better and necessary to allow QP/base64 output by
 the ezmlm-manage -list command.
-Added ezmlm-warn -t switch to modify bounce time-out as well as moved the
 compile-time default to idx.h (Thanks Mark Delany).
-Added note on "make clean" to INSTALL/UPGRADE.idx (Thanks Peter Hunter).
-Added support for message numbers in the prefix. This violates mail standards,
 but is very popular in Japan. (Thanks KI for inspiring this.) ezmlm-idx-0.30
 does prefix differently, so that it modifies the subject as little as possible
 for compliance with IETF recs and rfcs. ezmlm-idx-0.23 when prefix was used,
 used a processed and unfolded subject, which was less correct, and could cause
 problems with very long subjects.
-Changed MAXEDIT to 10k. This should accomodate all reasonable dir/text files.
 A limit _is_ required (see FAQ: SECURITY).
-Made any _user-generated_ commands case-insensitive throughout (ezmlm-get,
 -manage, -request). Note: ezmlm-generated ones, such as "list-accept" are
 still case-sensitive. (Thanks GS for reminding me.)
-Separated ezmlm-make switches for SENDER checks. -u for posts, -g for archive.
 Also changed names of other switches. -n for text file editing, -d for
 digest list. ezmlm-manage edit is now -eE, but the old -dD is still accepted.
-Modified most programs to service requests for both list and digest list,
 depending on LOCAL. For ezmlm-warn a command line -d switch is used to
 process digest bounces. Created copy.h/c as a general routine that
 does encoding and on-the-fly substitution of <#l#> to the name of the list
 being serviced. ezmlmrc modified to set up list appropriately and create
 a digest list for switch -d. The very rudimentary digest list is always
 called 'list-digest' for the list 'list' and lives as a subscriber and a
 bounce dir in dir/digest. log.c modified to take the dir as an argument.
 copy.c introduced. Can deal with encoding and substitution for <#l#>,
 <#B#>, <#R#>.
-Made dir/extra standard. All subscriber restriction (ezmlm-make -u) is
 to accept addresses that are subscribers of either list or in dir/extra.
-Added REMOVE as a forbidden subject in ezmlm-reject.
-Added support for rejection based on message and message part MIME
 Content-type. ezmlm-send can from composite MIME messages filter out
 body parts based on content-type. Trailers are added as MIME parts
 to composite MIME messages and in the Content-transfer-encoding of the
 message for single body messages.
-min and max message size restrictions moved from ezmlm-send/store to
 ezmlm-reject.
-Added support for optional base64 and quoted-printable encoding of trailer
 and all outgoing ezmlm messages. The same encodings are accepted as input
 for moderator comments and edited text files.
-Added hash for threading due to inconsistent/incorrect handling of LWSP
 by iso-2022-jp MUAs. Now threading works for rfc2047 encoded subjects.
-Added support for rfc2047 encoded From: lines and continuation for From:
 lines.
-Moved relevant parts of idxsub.c into ezmlm-send and ezmlm-idx.
-Added MIME en/decoding routines to support rfc2047 encoded subject lines.
 Also, added code to remove redundant ESC sequences when unfolding headers
 in iso-2022-jp* and iso-2022-cn* and iso-2022-kr. Only iso-2022-jp has been
 tested.
-Added ezmlm-idx -d switch to use date from 'Date:' header instead of the
 qmail received line. For old archives processed through ezmlm-send to
 re-archive. Remove (GMT), (PST), and DOW, and make 2-digit years xx where
 xx >= 70 19xx and others 20xx.


ezmlm-idx-0.231, 1998-03-02
===========================
-ezmlm-check.sh elsif -> elif.
-Allowed ezmlm-make -a switch (was missing; Thanks MF).
-Removed subject truncation for index: for prefixed lists it is used and
rfc2047-encoded subjects are often longer.
-Fixed idxsub.c bug (subject continuation lines skipped by ezmlm-idx if
 'Subject:' is after 'From:'). (Thanks, SOH.)


ezmlm-idx-0.23, 1998-01-20
==========================
-ezmlm-check fixed to remove bash-specific pattern matching. (Thanks, VV).
-ezmlm-both now makes completely functional list & digest list with digest
 creation from dir/editor. If address is given, it becomes the owner, remote
 admin, and a subscriber of both lists. By default, the remote admin is allowed
 to get a subscriber list.
-updated ezmlmrc.fr.
-ezmlm commands now have alternates defined via idx.h, allowing aliases, rather
 than replacement of command names in non-English domain.
-Modified ezmlm-tstdig to run easily from within dir/editor and dir/manager.
 Had to add dir/tstdig timestamp when run from dir/editor, to prevent triggering
 a new digest while one is being made. Now no new request is issued within one
 hour after the last one.
 Changed ezmlmrc to make this default for digested lists.
-New switches for ezmlm-make.
-Added ezmlm-get -f and -t switches for easier use on the command line and
 in dir/editor. Made it "context-sensitive" by testing LOCAL.
-Via ezmlmrc added -q switch for processing commands to list-request,
 a -3 hrs switch to configure ezmlm-tstdig in dir/manager, and some cleanup
 in texts.
-Modified ezmlm-make to fall back to system ezmlmrc files (with warning)
 if the -c switch is used by no custom ezmlmrc file is found. This makes
 it possible for a GUI to rely more on ezmlm-make.
-Added ezmlm-request to redirect 'Subject:' line requests.
-Added ezmlm-cron, a very restrictive crond interface enabling users
 without direct cron access to generate digest trigger messages. Suitable
 to be run from scripts for non-shell users as well. See ezmlm-cron.1.
-modified ezmlmrc to set up sublists (-0 sublist@subhost), directories in
 dir/modpost|modsub|remote with -789, and SENDER restriction on posts and
 archive retrieval (-6 digest_dir). Doc'd in ezmlm-make.1.
-modified ezmlm-make to allow </file#^5/> meaning -5 not defined/empty.
-ezmlm-issubn -n[egate] switch to make 'blacklisting' of SENDERs easier.
-ezmlm-get TOC loop starts at first message with the given subject, rather
 than first message in range.
-Added time and author to the subject index. The TOC now has author info.
 Changes made so that the programs run fine with old or mixed old/new subject
 index files.
-removed == n == from rfc1153 digest messages.
-Allowed for -dig.code[range]-targetlocal=targethost in ezmlm-get. Makes
 it easier to trigger digests since SENDER "faking" is no longer required.
-ezmlmrc changed to add 'Precedence: bulk' to dir/headeradd. For "vacation".
-Added ezmlm-manage -edit and -edit.file actions. If the -d switch is
 used, they allow remote admins to edit dir/text files.
-Modified ezmlm-send to use the main list message number if the message
 sender has the correct format and if the list is a non-archived sublist.
-Added tosubs.c, putsubs.c, qputsubs.c for subscriber address output,
 modified issub.c and subscribe.c, and put all into subdb.a. subscribe.h
 modified to become the general header file for subscriber database interface.
 issub() returns (char *)matching_address for compatibility with later packages.
 Modified all programs interfacing with subscriber databases to use these
 routines. In all a consistent interface. Using ezmlm with a different
 subscriber database manager requires changes to these routines only.
-Modified ezmlm-make and ezmlmrc to store all config info in dir/config, and
 also read it from there if ezmlm-make is invoked in edit mode with the 
 'dir' argument only.
-Fixed ezmlm-manage to make all output MIME using dir/charset (Thanks, SK).


ezmlm-idx-0.221, 1998-01-01
===========================
-Fixed ezmlm-send bug causing problems with undefined SENDER.
 (Thanks, Sadhu, TR).
-Fixed ezmlm-make lock file name bug (Thanks, SOH).


ezmlm-idx-0.22, 1997-12-10
==========================
-Added 'make clean' and TARGETS. (Thanks, TF).
-man page and FAQ updates. Some of FAQ info moved into a 'USAGE' section
 of the man pages.
-Bug fixed: caused ezmlm-make to ignore the -c switch.
-Added -3456-78-90 switches to ezmlm-make. They take a command line argument
 and substitute it for <#3#>, <#4#>, etc, in ezmlmrc.
-Added code to ezmlm-gate to enable it to pass switches to both ezmlm-send
 and ezmlm-store (which have and need to keep non-overlapping switches).
-Added multi-moddir capability to ezmlm-gate, which now becomes the
 standard tool for SENDER-restricting posts. ezmlm-store does this the
 slightly more involved but much more secure way.
-Added -C no copy to sender switch to ezmlm-send. Useful for small lists.
-Added -d digdir switch to ezmlm-get. When specified, SENDER is accepted
 for -get/thread/index only if a subscriber of the main list or the list
 based in digdir.
-ezmlm-manage sends help in reply to a specific list-help request, even if
 the list is not public.
-Added ezmlm-send -cC switches controlling post to self (Thanks TF, JS).
-Modified ezmlmrc to add a few switches: -t (trailer), -f (prefix),
 -l (subscriber list to remote admins, if any).
-Added ezmlm-tstdig which tests if a specified number of messages, message
 body bytes, or time have passed since the last digest creation. Added
 support for this in ezmlm-send and ezmlm-get.
-Added ezmlm-issub, and ezmlm-issubn (tests if SENDER is in any of a number
 of subscriber databases). Thanks Mark Delany for the original ezmlm-issub.
-Modified issub.c and subscribe.c to make subscriber database storage
 and comparisons case-insensitive (backwards compatible).
-Removed ezmlm-warn from ezmlmrc setup of DIR/bouncer. This helps big
 lists with lots of bounces.
-Added locking of list dir to ezmlm-make when used in -e [edit] mode.
-Bug: ezmlm-send would make all subjects 'Re: something' even if they were
 not replies for non-indexed lists with a subject prefix. Thanks, Ximenes
 Zalteca (ximenes@mythic.net) for reporting this.


ezmlm-idx-0.21, 1997-11-15
==========================
-Slightly improved ezmlm-both (now works even for non-remote admin setups).
 It's still very pedestrian.
-Added a few rfc1893 error codes.
-Added -rR option to ezmlm-clean to control sender notification of time-out.
-Bug: in ezmlm-idx missing message->continue (was break). Caused abort if
 archive messages are missing (uncommon, but possible if user decides to
 delete a few). (Tanks MF).
-More strict on Re[...]: in idxsub: '...' has to be digits and ']' is
 required. ':' is optional for broken MUAs. Swedish 'Ang:' accommodated.
-Added 'Content-Disposition:' header to digest messages from ezmlm-get per
 rfc2183 (Thanks, SK). Removed Content-Type: message/rfc822 txt, since it
 is the default.
-Updated man pages and FAQ for new features.
-ezmlm-send no longer requires DIR/num. If it's not there, it's assumed to
 be zero and created. This helps ezmlm-make -e.
-Added ezmlm-make '-e' 'edit' switch. Modified ezmlmrc accordingly.
-Added ezmlm-check script to help diagnose ezmlm list setup errors. Need to
 add checks for DIR/text messages.
-ezmlm-store now pipes the message to ezmlm-send if DIR/modpost is not present.
 Removing DIR/modpost will make a message moderated list non-moderated.
-Added ezmlm-gate which pipes to ezmlm-send/ezmlm-mode depending on membership
 in an address database. This is now a installed C program.
-ezmlm-get no longer requires index to be executable. Also, improved handling
 of missing index files in indexed archive (no FATAL error, except for master
 subject in 'thread' and that should be fixable ...). Added new format specifier
 'n' for 'not threaded'. Affects -get and -dig.
-Bug: Fixed ezmlm-idx to create index via temp file (indexn) and chmod to 700.
 (Thanks Toshinori Maeno).
-Removed charset from multipart/digest header (Thanks SK).
-Bug: Added <#D#> to ezmlm-warn line under </owner/> in ezmlmrc.


ezmlm-idx-0.20, 1997-10-30
==========================
-Requests to ezmlm-moderate to accept/reject already processed messages
 returns an error ONLY if the requested action is different from the actual
 fate of the message. Keeps moderators happier in multi-moderator lists,
 without info loss, with less traffic.
-A moderator's (un)subscribe CONFIRM reply results in target notification,
 only if the target's status changed. Multiple moderators confirming no
 longer yields multiple messages to target.
-ezmlm-manage copy() takes 2 arguments, the file name and a fall-back file
 name in case the first file does not exist. CONFIRM requests to moderators
 use text/mod-(un)sub-confirm (fall back: text/(un)sub-confirm). ezmlmrc
 changed to set these up.
-Added MIME header to ezmlm-get -index response (to get DIR/charset effect).
-Updated docs and FAQ.idx.
-Pre-release compile testing on several platforms. (Thanks YG, ARB, MF, SK).
-Added DIR/msgsize. If it exists and is not 0, ezmlm-send and ezmlm-store will
 bounce posts in excess of 'msgsize' bytes body size.
-Fixed ezmlm-clean to that when multiple messages time out, the message-id:s
 are different.
-ezmlm-clean and ezmlm-moderate now by default return the post as a
 MIME attachment. Use '-M' for old format.
-Rewrote ezmlm-make to work from the ezmlmrc template file for better
 and easier customization. Changed moderator rejection comment tag to '%%%'
 from '###' to support '#' as a comment character in ezmlmrc. '###' still
 works.
-Added DIR/sequence for optional message number header, and DIR/charset for
 character set. Thanks, SK. Default Compiled is now US-ASCII, as per rfc2046.
-Added TEST.idx, SECURITY.idx.
-ezmlm-get allows remote admins archive access even for non-public lists. The
 ezmlm-get -pP switches override DIR/public effects.
-ezmlm-manage still does moderator-initiated (un)sub when DIR/public is absent.
-Fixed bug: Updated MIME to rfc2046. With this the ezmlm-get 'm' format is no
 longer rfc1153-like. 'r' still gives rfc1153. Moderation attachments are now
 message/rfc822. Hopefully, the pine attachment viewer will catch up.
 Thanks, YG [and Mutt developers] for teaching me the errors of my ways. Also,
 see ezmlm-get.1(BUGS).
-ezmlm-manage gives moderator help and does list if target is moderator,
 rather than sender. Allows moderator to access from secondary account (to
 which mail sent to the primary account is forwarded).
-ezmlm-store checks DIR/modpost for leading '/' and if found assumes that the
 first line is the base directory for message moderators.
-ezmlm-manage checks DIR/modsub and DIR/remote contents for a leading '/'.
 If found, it is assumed to be the base-dir for moderators. NB: if both
 DIR/modsub and DIR/remote have entries, only DIR/modsub is used, i.e. it
 is not possible to have different dbs for remote admin and (un)sub mods.
-Modified ezmlm-manage to add separate moderator confirm commands (tc/vc)
 to allow also subscription moderator via forwarded mail. This is essentially
 a total rewrite of ezmlm-manage. Also, the -S and -U switches were added to
 allow optional omission of the user confirm phase for (un)subscribe.
 USE OF THESE SWITCHES DRASTICALLY DECREASES SECURITY, except for
 moderated lists. Since there have been many request for this (and it
 seems reasonable in some circumstances) these options have been added.
 Make sure you understand the consequences if you use them.
-Fixed bug: Added exit code to ezmlm-moderate. Thanks BG.
-Added include for sys/types.h to ezmlm-clean.c and ezmlm-store.c, changed
 ulong/uint to unsigned long/int, removed void from empty parameter lists for
 two functions, all to compile on BSDI 2.1 and Sun. Thanks, ARB and TE.
-Combined ezmlm-mod with ezmlm-idx and fused mod.h into idx.h.

ezmlm-idx-0.12, 1997-09-10
==========================
-Cleanups to allow compile on SGI.  Thanks MF.

ezmlm-idx-0.11, 1997-09-07
==========================
-Fixed bug: ezmlm-idx failed to check for error return from issub.c.
-Fixed bug: ezmlm-idx would crash on empty subjects.
-Moved out command names and lengths to idx.h making changing to other
 languages easier. Please use this only for totally local lists.
-Added -cC switches to ezmlm-get to disable all but -dig. Useful for secret
 lists that are archived and digested.
-Fixed bug: -dig would give "nothing to digest" with only 1 new message. Now
 it sends that message out (previously, this message would have been in the
 next digest as soon as more messages had arrived).
-Added DIR/prefix. If it exists, it is prefixed to outgoing subjects. Not
 added to archive/index. ezmlm-idx deals with it. 'Re: ' is prefixed for
 replies, since we use reply-parsed subject in ezmlm-send. A lot of pain for
 little gain, but for some reason this seems to be a 'must'.
-Changed idxsub routines to return 1 if reply indicators were fund, 0 else.
-Changed idxthread routines from int to void (don't return anything).
-Split out errtxt.h from idx.h in anticipation of ezmlm-mod.
-changed ezmlm-send to honor 'mailing-list' in headerremove.
-fixed ezmlm-make to deal with non-archived and non-indexed lists and to
 point out that -index works in sets of 100.
-ezmlm-get error msg on non-sub -thread request fixed.
-Added DIR/text/trailer. If it exists, it is added to all messages, as
 suggested by Fred B. Ringel. It is not copied to the archive.
-ezmlm-make changed to adapt text/bottom to archived/indexed status of list.
-Fixed usage text for ezmlm-send.
-'Reply-To:' header from messages is included in standard MIME digests
 (after reading Dan's comments on Reply-To munging). rfc1153 doesn't allow it.
-Changed ezmlm-get.c default to NOT restrict get/index/thread to subscribers.
-Fixed ezmlm-get.1 to correctly reflect effect of -s/-S switches.
-Fixed FAQ and added more info.

ezmlm-idx-0.10, 1997-08-01
==========================
-Added several items to FAQ.
-Made digestcode case-insensitive.
-Fixed format bugs causing trouble with PINE (Thanks Fred B. Ringel).
-Improved handling of missing index file in indexed archives.
-Added info on -get and -index restrictions to text/bottom.
-Added FAQ.idx (a little silly at the moment ;-).
-Added CHANGES.idx.
 Updated README.idx, UPDATE.idx, ezmlm.5 and other man pages.
-Added text/digest to allow standard info to be added to the list. A place
 holder is put in by ezmlm-manage, since the exact info depends on the
 digest list.
-Moved all error messages into defines in idx.h to support alternative
 languages.
-folded subject indexing into ezmlm-send.
-ezmlm-get.c: Added -s (default) restricting -get, -index, -thread to
 subscribers. -S on the command line removes this restriction.
-Added support for the horrid German 'Aw:' and 'Aw[..]:' replies.
-All linear white space is converted to a single ' ' in subject indexing.
 Existing archives should be re-indexed using the new ezmlm-idx. Probably rarely
 needed, but it's more correct.
-Added support for subject continuation lines (rfc822). Probably very rarely
 needed.
-Limited '-thread' to +/- 2000 messages (defines in ezmlm-get.c) from the
 "master message" to limit resource use on large archives.
-Changed limit for '-get' to 50 messages, '-index' to 20 sets (2000 subjects).
-Added digestcode support to ezmlm-make as a 5th argument. Default=blank.
-Added arguments to digest option. If one is given, digesting starts with that
 message and dignum/digissue are used/updated. If both are given, dignum and
 digissue are not updated and the issue number is the number of the first
 message in the archive.
-Added digest support. Enabled by specifying a 'digestcode'last on the
 ezmlm-get command line.
-Removed the now redundant -fF (filter) and -qQ (quote) options.
-Changed message format for returned messages allowing rfc1153, MIME
 multipart/digest, or MIME multipart/digest ordering and retaining only headers
 as per rfc1153, with the addition of 'Content-Type:' to better support
 alternative character sets. The latter format is the default.
-Fixed bug in -thread: search for messages was set to start at the beginning
 of the index containing the "master message", rather than at the beginning of
 the archive.
-Fixed bug: A few stralloc* were incorrectly stdio* in sindex.c.

ezmlm-idx-0.02, 1997-07-02
==========================
-Adapted to changes in ezmlm-0.52 => ezmlm-0.53.

ezmlm-idx-0.01, 1997-06-15
==========================
