.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-receipt
[
.B \-dD
]
.I dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-receipt
handles mail from sublists of the main list
stored in
.I dir
and, if it exists, the associated main digest list.
.B ezmlm-receipt
is used for main list with only sublists as subscribers. It is not
useful for normal mailing lists.

.B ezmlm-receipt
is normally invoked from a
.B .qmail
file.
It reads a mail message from its standard input,
and a mail envelope from the
.BR SENDER ,
.BR LOCAL ,
and
.BR HOST
environment variables.

.B ezmlm-receipt
has two functions. It takes the place of
.B ezmlm-receipt(1)
for main lists that have only sublists as subscribers.
Bounces do not lead to removal of the bouncing
address.
.B emzlm-receipt
saves the
bounce, and logs the event to the mail log.
.B ezmlm-receipt
also saves the bounce to
.I dir\fB/bounce/dnnn.ppp
where
.B nnn
is a time stamp and
.B ppp
the PID of the process. A maximum of 50 bounces are saved. Further bounces
are discarded until room is made in the bounce directory by manually removing
files.
If the list uses and SQL
database, the even is logged to the _mlog table instead, and only if the
distribution cookie matches. The bounce is still saved, but only if it
contained a matching distribution cookie.

.B ezmlm-receipt
also handles feedback messages from the sublist. These are used to monitor
that the sublist is able to send out messages. Receipt of feedback messages
is logged to the mail log.
If the list uses and SQL
database, the even is logged to the _mlog table instead, and only if the
distribution cookie matches.
