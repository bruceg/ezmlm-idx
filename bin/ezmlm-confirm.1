.TH ezmlm-confirm 1
.SH NAME
ezmlm-confirm \- process user actions for message
confirm and discard
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-confirm [-cCrRvV]
.I dir [ /path/program args ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-confirm
reads a mail message, expecting it to contain an
.I -confirm
or 
.I -discard
action request for the mailing list stored in
.I dir.

.B ezmlm-confirm
verifies the cookie sent as part of the action request, and if correct
attempts to find the corresponding message in
.IR dir\fB/mod/unconfirmed/ .
If the message is found, it is either discarded or posted to the list,
depending on the action request.

Posts to the list are handled by
piping the message to
.B ezmlm-send(1)
located in the ezmlm binary directory, as set at compile time. This is
usually the directory that ezmlm-moderate resides in.
.B ezmlm-send(1)
is provided with
.I dir
as the first argument.

If the optional second argument is given,
.B ezmlm-confirm
pipes the message to that program.
No additional parameters are supplied.

.I dir
is passed as an argument to
.BR ezmlm-send(1) ,
but NOT to any program specified as the optional
.B ezmlm-confirm
command line argument.

.B ezmlm-confirm
does not bother to correctly set sender.
.B ezmlm-send(1)
doesn't care, and any other program that might be used can parse the
sender from the first line of the message, which is always
.I Return-Path: <address@host.domain>
as build from SENDER originally passed to
.BR ezmlm-store(1) .

Once the message has been successfully accepted or discarded, it is removed from
.IR dir\fB/mod/unconfirmed/ .

If the message is not found in
.IR dir\fB/mod/unconfirmed/ ,
it has timed out and the message or
the message stub has been removed by
.BR ezmlm-clean(1) .
In this case,
.B ezmlm-confirm
notifies the sender of the failure.
Notification is in the form of a fatal error from qmail.

At the beginning of the message,
.B ezmlm-confirm
prints a new
.B Mailing-List
field with the contents of the
.I TXT_MAILING_LIST
message.  It rejects the message if there is already a
.B Mailing-List
field.

.B ezmlm-confirm
does not distribute bounce messages:
if the environment variable
.B SENDER
is set, and is either empty or
.BR #@[] ,
.B ezmlm-confirm
rejects the message.

If

exists,
.B ezmlm-confirm
will use the character set listed for all messages. Otherwise, the
default ``us-ascii'' will be used. The character set can be suffixed
by ``:'' followed by a code. If the code is ``Q'', outgoing messages are 
sent as ``Quoted-Printable'', if it is ``B'' they are sent ``base64'' encoded.
Otherwise, text is sent as is.
