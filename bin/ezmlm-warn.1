ezmlm-warn \- send out bounce warnings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-warn
[
.B \-dD

.I lockout
]
.I dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-warn
sends out warning messages
for the mailing list stored in
.IR dir .

.B ezmlm-warn
scans
.I dir\fB/bounce/d/
for directories older than
.I timeout
days ago (see
.BR \-t ).
The directories are created by
.B ezmlm-return
and contain bounces.
If
.B ezmlm-warn
sees a distribution bounce for
.I box\fB@\fIdomain
received more than
.I timeout
days ago,
it sends
.I box\fB@\fIdomain
a list of all the message numbers missed recently,
and deletes the bounce.
If it sees a warning bounce for
.I box\fB@\fIdomain
received more than
.I timeout
days ago,
it sends
.I box\fB@\fIdomain
a probe,
and deletes the bounce.

.B ezmlm-warn
uses
.I dir\fB/bounce/lastd
to keep track of when it was last run. If insufficient time has
passed (see
.BR \-l )
.B ezmlm-warn
exits without further action.

.B ezmlm-warn
keeps files with the bounced message numbers in
.IR dir\fB/bounce/h .
Expired files are removed and
.I dir\fB/bounce/lasth
keeps track of the last subdirectory scanned.

.B ezmlm-warn
will not send a warning or probe to an address that is
not currently a subscriber.

If neither the
.B \-d
nor the
.B \-D
option is given to
.BR ezmlm-warn ,
it will process bounces for both the main and digest lists.

.B ezmlm-warn
reads
.I dir\fB/copylines
to determine how many lines of the original message to copy into the
outgoing message.  If this file is empty or not present, a value of
.I 0
is presumed, meaning that only the header is copied.

If
.I dir\fB/nowarn
exists,
.B ezmlm-warn
exits without taking any action.

If
.I dir\fB/qmqpservers
exists,
.B ezmlm-warn will use
.B qmail-qmqp(1)
to send messages.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
process bounces only for the digest list.
Digest list bounces are stored in
.I dir\fB/digest/bounce/
rather than in
.IR dir\fB/bounce/ .
.TP
.B \-D
Process bounces only for the main list.
.TP
.B \-l \fIlockout
.B ezmlm-warn
will abort execution if it was run less than
.I lockout
seconds ago. The default is
.I timeout /
50, which with the default
.I timeout
is 20,000 seconds (approx. 5.6 hours). There is no reason to use this
switch, except for testing and possibly in combination with
.BR \-t.
.TP
.B \-t \fItimeout
Bounces received more than
.I timeout
days ago are processed. This overrides the default of 10 days
and may possibly be useful for very large busy lists. Also, a
.I timeout
of zero can be used to send a warning to all addresses for which
a bounce has been received and a probe for all addresses for which a
warning has bounces.
This is useful to rapidly clear
out bouncing addresses from a (low quality) address list.
