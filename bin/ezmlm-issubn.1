.TH ezmlm-issubn 1
.SH NAME
ezmlm-issubn \- test to see if an address is subscribed to a mailing list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-issubn
[
.B \-nN
]
.I dir
.I [ subdir1 ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-issubn
checks to see if the address obtained from the environment variable
.I SENDER
is subscribed to the mailing list stored in
.I dir/subdir1
or the mailing list in
.I dir/subdir2
or ...

If
.I SENDER
is not defined
.B ezmlm-issubn
exits with an error.

If
.I SENDER
is on [any of] the mailing list[s],
.B ezmlm-issubn
exits with a zero exit code.

If
.I box\fB@\fIdomain
is not on the mailing list,
.B ezmlm-issubn
exits 99. This exit code is non-success from a shell point of view, but to
qmail it means "success" and skip remaining lines in the .qmail file. Thus,
a simple way to execute a delivery if the
.ezmlm-issubn
criteria are met is to place the
.B ezmlm-issubn
line first, followed by the action line(s). If SENDER is a subscriber, the
action line is executed, if not, the line is ignored without the generation
of an error condition. To generate a fatal error, just:

.EX
|/path/ezmlm-issubn
.I dir ...
|| (echo "err msg"; exit 100)

|/path/action_for_subscribers
|/path/more_for_subscribers
.EE

.B ezmlm-issubn
exits 100 on permanent and 111 on temporary errors.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n
Negate exit code. Exit 99 if SENDER is a subscriber and exit 0 if not.
This is useful when trying to exclude SENDERs.
.TP
.B \-N
(Default.)
Normal exit codes: 0 is the address is in any of the lists, 99 if not.
.SH NOTES
The use of
.B ezmlm-issubn
is deprecated.  Use
.B ezmlm-checksub
instead.

To maintain backwards compatibility, if
.I dir1
(or more) are present on the command line and are all absolute paths,
.B ezmlm-issubn
examines each of the directories for the sender.  Otherwise, it only
examines the named subdirectories within
.IR dir .
