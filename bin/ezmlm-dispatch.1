.SH NAME
ezmlm-dispatch \- Dispatch an email to other ezmlm programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-dispatch
[
.B -vV
]
.I dir
[
.I list
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-dispatch
is used in a
.I .qmail-default
file to handle delivery to multiple mailing lists in a directory.  It
assumes each list has been created in a directory of the same name as
the list's local name.  It examines the value of
.I $DEFAULT
set by
.B qmail-local
to determine which list the message is destined to, and what file within
the list directory is to control the message delivery.

If the address matches:	Delivery is handled by:
LIST	\fBLIST/editor\fR
LIST-owner	\fBLIST/owner\fR
LIST-digest-owner	\fBLIST/owner\fR
LIST-digest-return-*	\fBLIST/bouncer\fR
LIST-return-*	\fBLIST/bouncer\fR
LIST-confirm-*	\fBLIST/confirmer\fR
LIST-discard-*	\fBLIST/confirmer\fR
LIST-accept-*	\fBLIST/moderator\fR
LIST-reject-*	\fBLIST/moderator\fR
LIST-*	\fBLIST/manager\fR

.RE
.P
If the optional
.I list
argument is present, it names the list, and
.I $DEFAULT
is only examined for what file is to control the delivery.  This can be
used to have
.B ezmlm-dispatch
control the operations of a single list.

If
.I dir\fB/qmqpservers
exists,
.B ezmlm-dispatch will use
.B qmail-qmqp(1)
to forward messages.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
Display
.B ezmlm-dispatch
version information.
.TP
.B -V

.B ezmlm-dispatch
version information.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B ezmlm-dispatch
exits with the first non-zero exit code from any of the programs it
executes, or zero otherwise.
.SH SEE ALSO
ezmlm-make(1), ezmlm-manage(1), ezmlm-send(1)
.SH CAVEATS
Unlike
.BR qmail-local ,
.B ezmlm-dispatch
changes directory into the list directory before executing any
commands.  Programs which expect to be executed from the starting
directory will fail.  No ezmlm-idx programs are impacted by this.
.P
For security reasons,
.B ezmlm-dispatch
does not allow delivery to any address with a "/" in it.  This will
break subscribe (and similar) confirmations for senders that use email
addresses with a "/" in them.
.P
In the case of
.B ezmlm-dispatch
handling a single list, it is not possible to use the
.I .qmail-LIST-default
file hand off control to the
.B editor
file for actual list delivery rather than administrative messages.  A
second
.I .qmail-LIST
file will still be necessary in this case.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.B ezmlm-dispatch
does not support delivery to mbox files or maildirs.
.P
.B ezmlm-dispatch
does not set
.IR $EXT ,
.IR $EXT2 ,
.IR $EXT3 ,
or
.I $EXT4
as
.B qmail-local
does when doing local deliveries.  None of the ezmlm programs use these
environment variables.
