.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-get
handles archive retrieval and optionally makes and sends out
digests for the mailing list
stored in
.IR dir .
Subscribers of the digest list are stored in
.IR dir\fB/digest/subscribers/ .

The contents of
.I dir\fB/headeradd
are added to the header of outgoing messages.

If
.I digestcode
is not specified on the command line,
.B ezmlm-get
will try to read it from the file
.I dir\fB/digestcode .

.B ezmlm-get
is normally invoked from a
.B .qmail(7)
file.  It reads a mail message from its standard input, and a mail
envelope from the
.BR SENDER ,
.BR LOCAL ,
and
.BR HOST
environment variables.

.B ezmlm-get
uses
.B LOCAL
to determine where it is invoked. If
.B LOCAL
is the list local name only,
.B ezmlm-get
assumes it is run from
.I dir\fB/editor
to produce a digest.
The digest is sent directly to the digest list subscribers.

If
.B LOCAL
is empty or undefined,
.B ezmlm-get
assumes it is run from the command line or a script. In this case
it behaves as if run from
.I dir\fB/editor
and sends out a digest to the digest subscribers.

Otherwise,
.B ezmlm-get
expects
.B LOCAL
to be of the form
.IR list\fB-\fIaction .
Here
.I list
is the first line of
.IR dir\fB/outlocal
and
.I action
is a request.
The output is sent to the envelope sender.

.BR ezmlm-get
checks
.I action
for
.BR dig\.\fIdigestcode ,
.BR index ,
.BR thread ,
and
.BR get .
If 
.I action
is one of these,
.B ezmlm-get
handles the request and sends a reply. If successful, it
exits 99 (ignore remaining
.B .qmail(7)
file entries).
If
.I action
is not one of these,
.B ezmlm-get
exits 0 (success) to pass the message on to later handlers,
such as
.BR ezmlm-manage(1) .

.BR ezmlm-dig\.\fIdigestcode
returns a digest of messages received since the last digest, unless
numerical arguments are given.
.I digestcode
must be alphanumeric, and match (case-insensitive)
.I digestcode
on the
.B ezmlm-get
command line. Otherwise, the request will be ignored. This is to restrict
digest creation. The body of the requesting message up to the first line
starting with '-' is copied into the
.I administrivia 
section of the digest. This is followed by the contents of
.IR dir\fB/text/digest ,
if this file exists.

.B Note:
Anyone who can read your
.I dir\fB/manager
and
.I dir\fB/digestcode
files, digest-requesting scripts, or mail log knows the
.I digestcode
and can trigger digests.

.B ezmlm-get
copies the
.I TXT_MAILING_LIST
message into a
.B Mailing-List
field in its response.
If the incoming message has a
.B Mailing-List
field,
.B ezmlm-get
refuses to respond.
.B ezmlm-get
also refuses to respond to bounce messages.

If
.I dir\fB/listid
exists,
.B ezmlm-get
will assume that the format is correct and
create a ``List-ID:'' header by placing the contents after the
text ``List-ID: ''. 

If
.I dir\fB/qmqpservers
exists,
.B ezmlm-get will use
.B qmail-qmqp(1)
to send messages.

If
.I dir\fB/public
does not exist,
.B ezmlm-get
rejects all archive retrieval attempts, unless the
.B \-p
command line switch is used.

Archive retrieval actions can be of the form
.BR action[f] , 
.BR action[f].\fInum 
or 
.BR action[f].\fInum_num2 ,
where 
.I num
is the message number for the action or
.I num_num2
the range of message numbers for the action.

.B f
is an optional format specifier for
.IR \-get ,
.IR \-thread ,
and
.I \-dig
requests. It is allowed, but ignored for
.I \-index
requests. Currently, the following are allowed:

.TP
.B r
rfc1153. This is a ``plain'' non-MIME format for dumb clients.
.TP
.B m
(Default.) MIME
.I multipart/digest 
with a subset of ordered headers sorted.
Currently, the following headers are
included in the order listed:
Date:,
To:,
From:,
Reply-To:,
Cc:,
MIME-Version:,
Content-Type:,
Message-ID:,
and Keywords:.
This can be customized with the optional file
.IR dir\fB/digheaders ,
which should contain the desired headers up to but not including the colon.

The format is no longer compliant
with rfc1153, as the rfc1153 format is incompatible with rfc2046, with
which the format is (should be) compatible.
.TP
.B x
MIXED: This is the same as the default MIME
format, except that the Content-Type is
.IR multipart/mixed .
This helps circumnavigate a Pine bug: when the digest is
content-transfer-encoded, Pine will refuse to display the initial
text/plain part of a 
.I multipart/digest
message, but display the same part of a
.I multipart/mixed
message. Some MUAs for some strange reason treat the two multipart formats
differently. In some cases, ``x'' works better than ``m''.
.TP
.B v
VIRGIN: This is MIME
.I multipart/digest 
with messages returned without any header filtering.
.TP
.B n
NATIVE: This is VIRGIN format without threading, i.e. messages are
presented in numerical order and the message index is suppressed.

.PP
For flexibility and backwards compatibility, the '.' separating the action from
the first argument can be replaced by '\-',
or omitted.
Any non-alphanumeric character can separate
.I num2
from
.IR num .
.PP

If
.I action
is
.IR dig.digestcode ,
.B ezmlm-get
returns a digest of the messages received since the last digest, and updates
the digest issue counter.

If
.I action
is
.IR get ,
.B ezmlm-get
sends back message(s)
.I num
or
.I num
through
.IR num2 .
from
.IR dir\fB/archive/ .
If
.I num
is omitted and
.I dir\fB/dignum
does not exist or is 0, the latest HISTGET message (default 30) are
returned. Otherwise,
the messages since the latest digest are returned including the last
message in that digest, so that always at least 1 message is send. If the
number of messages
exceeds MAXGET (default 100), only the MAXGET last messages are returned.
if
.I num
is greater than the latest message in the archive _and_
.I num2
is specified, the latest messages back to HISTGET before the end of the
latest digest up to MAXGET messages are returned. This is a good way of
always getting at least the latest 30 messages without knowing the latest
message number. A link with such a command could be put into e.g.
.IR dir\fB/text/sub-ok .

.I num
and
.I num2
are adjusted to make both > 0, and
.I num2
>=
.IR num .
If either is greater than
the largest message number processed, it is silently
set to the largest message number.
At most 100 messages are
returned.

If
.I action
is
.BI index ,
.B ezmlm-get
sends back the subjects and authors of the message(s)
.I num
or
.IR num
through
.I num2
in sets of 100 from
.IR dir\fB/archive/ .
.I num
and
.I num2
are reasonable adjusted as for 'get'. No warnings are
sent. At most 20 sets of 100 message entries are returned per request. If
.I num
is omitted,
.B ezmlm-get
returns the last 100-200 message entries, which automatically gives
information about the last message number.

If
.I action
is
.BI thread ,
.B ezmlm-get
sends back the message(s) that have an index subject entry identical to
that of message
.I num 
from
.IR dir\fB/archive/ .

If
.I num2
is given it is ignored. If
.I num
is out of range, and error
message is returned. The message range scanned for the subject is limited
to 2000 messages before and after the master message, i.e. the
.BR thread
argument.
This limit protects very large archives.
Most threads are expected to be considerably more short-lived.
In the unlikely event that there are further messages,
these can be retrieved by a second request for the 
highest/lowest message returned in the first request.

.B ezmlm-get
reads
.I dir\fB/copylines
to determine how many lines of the original message to copy into the
outgoing message.  If this file is empty or not present, a value of
.I 0
is presumed, meaning that only the header is copied.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
(Default.)
Copy administrative information and the request to the bottom of replies.
This informs the recipient of other commands, and allows some error tracking
in case the recipient did not originate the request.  This is the
default unless the
.I dir\fB/omitbottom
file exists.
.TP
.B \-B
Suppress the normal administrative information and request copy. This may make
it harder for the recipient to diagnose problems and learn commands.
.TP
.B \-c
(Default.)
Process and reply to commands (does not affect digests).
.TP
.B \-C
Ignore all commands except digest.
.TP
.B \-f \fIformat
.B ezmlm-get
will use
.I format
as the default format for all returned message collections. The default
is the first character in
.IR dir\fB/digformat ,
or 'm' if it does not exist.  This produces MIME with a header subset
(see above). Format specifiers sent with individual requests override
the default set with the
.B \-f
switch or the
.I dir\fB/digformat
file.
.TP
.B \-p
\-get, \-index, and \-thread commands are available to all users,
provided other flags are permissive. This overrides normal behavior,
which is to allow archive retrieval only to moderators, when
.I dir\fB/modgetonly
exists or
.I dir\fB/public
does not exist. This is useful to set up non-public lists that still give
users archive access.
.TP
.B \-P
\-get, \-index, and \-thread commands are available
only to moderators, even if
.I dir\fB/public
exists and
.I dir\fB/modgetonly
does not. The
.B \-C
and
.B \-s
flags can restrict this further. This is useful for public lists with
archive retrieval restricted to a subset of users (moderators).
.TP
.B \-s
\-get, \-index, and \-thread requests are processed only if
.B SENDER
is a subscriber.  This overrides normal behavior, which is to allow
anyone to issue \-get, \-index, and \-thread requests unless
.I dir\fB/subgetonly
exists.
.TP
.B \-S
Anyone can issue \-get, \-index, and \-thread requests.
.TP
.B \-v
Print version info.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version info.
.SH "CHARACTER SETS"
If
.I dir\fB/charset
exists,
.B ezmlm-get
will use the character set listed for all messages. Otherwise, the
default ``us-ascii'' will be used. The character set can be suffixed
by ``:'' followed by a code. If the code is ``Q'', outgoing messages are 
sent as ``Quoted-Printable'', if it is ``B'' they are sent ``base64'' encoded.
Otherwise, text is sent as is.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I dir\fB/dignum
The last message included in the latest normal mode digest.
.TP
.I dir\fB/digissue
The issue number of the latest normal mode digest.
.TP
.I dir\fB/text/get-bad
Returned if a/the message cannot be found.
.TP
.I dir\fB/text/digest
Copied into the
.I Administrivia
section of digests after the body of the requesting message.
.TP
.I dir\fB/charset
The character set used for all
.B ezmlm-get
messages (see above).
If not present, the default, ``us-ascii'', is used without encoding.
.SH BUGS
The digest format per rfc2046
should (but is not required to) be multipart/mixed
with the table-of-contents a text/plain part, and the entire remainder of
the digest a multipart/digest part. The multipart/digest in turn should 
contain all the messages. Many
MUA's fail to split out the individual messages from such a hierarchy, so the
format used by
.B ezmlm-get
is a simple multipart/digest, explicitly typing the table-of-contents
to text/plain, with the ``x'' format changing the mail content-type to
multipart/mixed.
