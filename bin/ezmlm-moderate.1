.SH NAME
ezmlm-moderate \- process moderator actions for message
acceptance and rejection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-moderate [-cCmMrRvV]
.B [-t\fI reply-to@host\fB]
.I dir [ /path/program args ... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-moderate
reads a mail message, expecting it to contain an
.I -accept
or 
.I -reject
action request for the mailing list stored in
.I dir.

.B ezmlm-moderate
verifies the cookie sent as part of the action request, and if correct
attempts to find the corresponding message in
.IR dir\fB/mod/pending/ .
If the message is found, it is either rejected or posted to the list,
depending on the action request.

Posts to the list are handled by
piping the message to
.B ezmlm-send(1)
located in the ezmlm binary directory, as set at compile time. This is
usually the directory that ezmlm-moderate resides in.
.B ezmlm-send(1)
is provided with
.I dir
as the first argument.

If the optional second argument is given,
.B ezmlm-moderate
pipes the message to that program.
No additional parameters are supplied.

.I dir
is passed as an argument to
.BR ezmlm-send(1) ,
but NOT to any program specified as the optional
.B ezmlm-moderate
command line argument.

.B ezmlm-moderate
does not bother to correctly set sender.
.B ezmlm-send(1)
doesn't care, and any other program that might be used can parse the
sender from the first line of the message, which is always
.I Return-Path: <address@host.domain>
as build from SENDER originally passed to
.BR ezmlm-store(1) .

If the message is rejected, an optional moderator comment is copied into the
notification to the message sender.
A moderator comment is any text in the
.I -reject
request found between two lines with ``%%%'' starting in one of the first
5 positions of the line. The easiest is to use lines consisting of ``%%%''
only. If the characters preceeding the ``%%%'' are found at the beginning
of any lines within the comment, the characters are removed. This is to
appropriately ignore any ``quote marks'' that you mail program might place at
the beginning of lines in a reply.

.B ezmlm-moderate
messages are sent ``From:''
.IR list-owner@listhost .
This allows the poster to easily complain to the owner of the list, in case
s/he objects. An optional ``Reply-To:'' header can be added via the
.BR \-r\fI\ reply-to@host .

Once the message has been successfully accepted or rejected, it is removed from
.I dir\fB/mod/pending/
and a stub is created in
.I dir\fB/mod/accepted/
or
.IR dir\fB/mod/rejected/ ,
respectively.
This is done in order to be able to notify the senders of later moderation
requests about the fate of the message.

A failure to find the message in
.I dir\fB/mod/pending/
is most often caused by the message already having been accepted or rejected
by another moderator. Therefore,
.B ezmlm-moderate
looks in
.I dir\fB/mod/accepted/
and
.I dir\fB/mod/rejected/
for a message stub. If found, 
.B ezmlm-moderate
notifies the sender in the form of a fatal error
if the fate of the message was different from
that intended by the current action request.
Otherwise, the fate of the message is silently logged.

If the message is not found, it has timed out and the message or
the message stub has been removed by
.BR ezmlm-clean(1) .
In this case,
.B ezmlm-moderate
notifies the moderator of the failure, but can no longer discern the fate
of the original message. Again, notification is in the form of a fatal
error from qmail.

At the beginning of the message,
.B ezmlm-moderate
prints a new
.B Mailing-List
field with the contents of the
.I TXT_MAILING_LIST
message.  It rejects the message if there is already a
.B Mailing-List
field.

.B ezmlm-moderate
does not distribute bounce messages:
if the environment variable
.B SENDER
is set, and is either empty or
.BR #@[] ,
.B ezmlm-moderate
rejects the message.

If
.I dir\fB/qmqpservers
exists,
.B ezmlm-moderate will use
.B qmail-qmqp(1)
to send messages.
