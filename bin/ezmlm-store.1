.TH ezmlm-store 1
.SH NAME
ezmlm-store \- store messages posted to a moderated lists and send
moderation requests to the moderator(s).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-store [-bBcCmMpPrRsSvVyY]
.I dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-store
stores a main message sent to a ezmlm mailing list awaiting
message moderation or user confirmation.

If the
.B \-y
option is set, or
.I dir\fB/confirmpost
exists and the
.B \-Y
option is not set, it works in user confirmation mode.  Otherwise if
.I dir\fB/modpost
exists, it works in message moderation mode.
Otherwise the message is passed on to
.BR ezmlm-send(1) .

If either
.I dir\fB/modpostonly
exists or the
.B \-P
option is set, only moderators will be allowed to post.  Posts from
other addresses are bounced.
.SH "USER CONFIRMATION"
.B ezmlm-store
reads a mail message and
stores it in
.IR dir\fB/mod/unconfirmed/ .
.B ezmlm-store
also sends a user confirmation request with a copy of the message to the
envelope sender of the message.
The confirm request includes cookies for message rejection and acceptance.

The sender can take either action by replying to the appropriate address.
For user convenience, the
.I confirm
address is given in
the ``Reply-To:'' header.

Once the confirmation request has been successfully sent,
.B ezmlm-store
sets the owner-execute bit of the message in
.IR dir\fB/mod/unconfirmed/ .
Messages without this bit set are the result of incomplete executions of
.B ezmlm-store
and are ignored.

.SH MODERATION
.B ezmlm-store
reads a mail message and
stores it in
.I dir\fB/mod/pending/.
.B ezmlm-store
also sends a moderation request with a copy of the message to the list of
moderators stored in
.I dir\fB/mod/subscribers/.
If
.I dir\fB/modpost
contains a directory name,
.IR moddir ,
with a leading forward slash, the moderator list in
.I /moddir/subscribers/
is used instead. This allows separate sets of moderators for
subscription and message moderation, as
well as the use of the same moderator list for several
.B ezmlm
mailing lists, owned by the same user. If the
.B \-s
switch is used, the moderators are divided into two sets. Those pointed to by
.I dir\fB/modpost
which will receive confirmation requests for posts with their SENDER address,
and those stored with the base directory
.I dir\fB/mod/
which will receive moderation requests for messages posted from SENDERs not
part of the first group. This can be used to have a set of trusted
users (``moderating'' themselves to thwart SENDER faking), and a set of more
traditional moderators, which receive approval requests for other posts.

.B Note:
The contents of
.I dir\fB/modpost
do not affect the location of the message moderation queue.

If SENDER is a moderator, the request is sent
to that moderator only.

The moderation request includes cookies for message rejection and acceptance.
The moderator can take either action by replying to the appropriate address.
For moderator convenience, the
.I accept
address is given in
the ``Reply-To:'' header, and the
.I reject
address in the ``From:'' header.

If the list is set up with remote administration and the sender is not a
moderator, the ``Cc:'' header will contain a confirmation address to add
the sender to the ``allow'' database. This allows the moderator to both
approve the post and add the sender to the list of accepted posters by
replying to ``all''.

The default subject of all message moderation requests is
.B MODERATE for
.IR listname@host .
The default subject of all message confirmation requests is
.B Confirm post to
.IR listname@host .

Once the request has been successfully sent to the moderators, 
.B ezmlm-store
sets the owner-execute bit of the message in
.I dir\fB/mod/pending/.
Messages without this bit set are the result of incomplete executions of
.B ezmlm-store
and are ignored.

.SH "CONFIRMATION AND MODERATION MESSAGES"
At the beginning of the message,
.B ezmlm-store
prints a new
.B Mailing-List
field with the contents of the
.I TXT_MAILING_LIST
message.  It rejects the message if there is already a
.B Mailing-List
field.

.B ezmlm-store
does not distribute bounce messages:
if the environment variable
.B SENDER
is set, and is either empty or
.BR #@[] ,
.B ezmlm-store
rejects the message.

If
.I dir\fB/qmqpservers
exists,
.B ezmlm-store will use
.B qmail-qmqp(1)
to send messages.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
(Default.)
With the moderation request,
send both headers and body of the message to be moderated.
.TP
.B \-B
With the moderation request,
send header, but not body of the message to be moderated.
This may be useful if moderation is used to allow one or a few poorly
connected addresses to post, and posts are very large (e.g. when the list
is used as a distribution channel of e.g. catalogs).
.TP
.B \-cCrR
Passed on to
.B ezmlm-send(1)
in case this program is executed. This happens only if neither
.I dir\fB/modpost
nor
.I dir\fB/confirmpost
exist.
.TP
.B \-m
(Default.)
The post is sent as a MIME enclosure.
.TP
.B \-M
The post is appended to the message.
.TP
.B \-s
The contents of
.I dir\fB/modpost
with the default
.I dir\fB/mod/
are used as the base directory for self-approving users, whereas
.I dir\fB/mod/
is used as the base directory
for the moderators to whom approval requests for other
posts are sent.
.TP
.B \-S
(Default.)
The contents of
.I dir\fB/modpost
with the default
.I dir\fB/mod/
are used as the base directory
for the moderators for all moderator functions.
.TP
.B \-p
(Default.)
Anyone can post. Posts that are not from a moderator are sent out to
all moderators for approval. Posts that are from a moderator are
sent only to that moderator. This is the default unless the
.I dir\fB/modpostonly
file exists.
.TP
.B \-P
Only moderators can post. Those posts are sent to the posting moderator
for approval. Posts from other addresses are bounced. This can be used
to relatively securely restrict posts to messages originating from
a given set of addresses.
.TP
.B \-y
Run in post confirmation mode even if
.IR dir\fB/confirmpost
does not exists.
.TP
.B \-Y
Ignore
.IR dir\fB/confirmpost.
(This option is useful if
.B ezmlm-store
is called after post confirmation, to allow message moderation.)
.TP
.B \-v
Display
.B ezmlm-store
version information.
.TP
.B \-V
Display
.B ezmlm-store
version information.
.SH USAGE
First of all, remember that
.B ezmlm-store
will simply execute
.B ezmlm-send(1)
unless
.I dir\fB/modpost
exists,
.I dir\fB/confirmpost
exists,
or
.B \-y
option is specified.
For the switches, use
.B \-P
for lists where only moderators can post securely, i.e. they are
asked to approve their own posts after posting,
whereas other SENDERs are rejected. For
low-security more convenient versions of this type of restriction, see
.BR ezmlm-gate(1) .

Normally (no switches),
posts from moderators are sent for approval only to the sending
moderator, whereas posts from other addresses are sent to all moderators.
Thus, you can set up an announcement list by adding all potential posters
as moderators. However, you may also want to allow others to post, as
long as the posts are approved. This would be default
.B ezmlm-store
function.

To make the set of ``approved posters'' who approve their own posts, different
from the set of addresses that approve posts from other users, use the
.B \-s
switch. Add a directory name to
.IR dir\fB/modpost .
This directory is the base directory of the ``approved posters''
database. Add the moderators for other posts to
.I dir\fB/mod/
using
.BR ezmlm-sub(1) .
.SH "CHARACTER SETS"
If
.I dir\fB/charset
exists,
.B ezmlm-store
will use the character set listed for all messages. Otherwise, the
default ``us-ascii'' will be used. The character set can be suffixed
by ``:'' followed by a code. If the code is ``Q'', outgoing messages are 
sent as ``Quoted-Printable'', if it is '`B'' they are sent ``base64'' encoded.
Otherwise, text is sent as is.
