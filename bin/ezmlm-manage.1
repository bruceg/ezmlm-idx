.SH NAME
ezmlm-manage \- automatically manage a mailing list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-manage [-bBcCdDeEfFlLmMsSqQuUvV]
.I dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-manage
handles administrative requests for the mailing list
stored in
.IR dir ,
as well as for the associated digest list.

.B ezmlm-manage
is normally invoked from a
.B .qmail
file.
It reads a mail message from its standard input,
and a mail envelope from the
.B SENDER
and
.BR DEFAULT
environment variables.

.B ezmlm-manage
expects
.B DEFAULT
to be of the form
.IR action\fB-\fIbox\fB=\fIdomain .
Here
.I action
is a request,
and
.I box\fB@\fIdomain
is the target of the request.
.B ezmlm-manage
sends a response to the target.
It attaches the original message to the end of its response.

.B DEFAULT
may instead be of the (simple) form
.IR action .
Then the envelope sender
is used as the target.

If
.I action
starts with
``digest'', the request is assumed to be for the
associated digest list.
.B ezmlm-manage
handles these requests similarly, except that digest list subscriber addresses
are stored in
.IR dir\fB/digest/subscribers ,
rather than in
.IR dir\fB/subscribers .

If
.I action
starts with ``allow'', the request is assumed to be for the
associated
.I dir\fB/allow/
database. This database is used to store aliases of subscribers for lists
allowing only posts only if the envelope sender is a subscriber.
Actions on the
.I dir\fB/allow/
database follow the same rules as for the main list. The ezmlm messages are
the same as those used for normal subscription, but refer to the
.I list\fB-allow@\fIhost
list. As this feature is designed for advanced uses and remote administrators
only, this is not a problem.
.B NOTE:
No message is sent out to confirm additions to or removals from this
database. However, the user can
verify the change using the
.I query
action.
If
.I action
starts with ``deny'', the command is applied simiparly to the
.I dir\fB/deny/
database for blocking posts with certain envelope senders.
This database is available
to remote administrators only, and only if the list has been set up with
this feature (see
.BR ezmlm-manage(1) ).
.B NOTE:
No message is sent out to confirm additions to or removals from this database.
However, the remote admin can
verify the change using the
.I query
action.

.B ezmlm-manage
copies the
.I TXT_MAILING_LIST
message into a
.B Mailing-List
field in its response.
If the incoming message has a
.B Mailing-List
field,
.B ezmlm-manage
refuses to respond.
.B ezmlm-manage
also refuses to respond to bounce messages.

.B ezmlm-manage
reads
.I dir\fB/copylines
to determine how many lines of the original message to copy into the
outgoing message.  If this file is empty or not present, a value of
.I 0
is presumed, meaning that only the header is copied.

If
.I dir\fB/qmqpservers
exists,
.B ezmlm-manage
will use
.B qmail-qmqp(1)
to send messages.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B \-a
Output an indicator of what action or response is being sent.
.TP 5
.B \-A
(Default.)
Do not output any action or response indicators.
.TP 5
.B \-b
(Default.)
.B ezmlm-manage
will add general instructions and the request to the outgoing message.
This is the default unless the
.I dir\fB/omitbottom
file exists.
.TP 5
.B \-B
.B ezmlm-manage
will not add general instructions and the request to the outgoing message.
This information gives the recipient of a confirmation request some
information about the inciting message. Use of this switch will deny the
recipient that information.
.TP 5
.B \-c
(Default.)
.B ezmlm-manage
will reply to
.I \-get
commands.
.TP
.B \-C
.B ezmlm-manage
will not reply to
.I \-get
commands. This is useful for closed lists, where the owner for
some reason wants to keep an archive, without making it available.
.TP 5
.B \-d
Alias for the
.B \-e
switch for backwards compatibility.
.TP 5
.B \-D
Alias for the
.B \-E
switch for backwards compatibility.
.TP 5
.B \-e
.B ezmlm-manage
allows remote administrators to edit files in
.I dir\fB/text/
via E-mail.
.TP 5
.B \-E
(Default.)
Text file editing not allowed.  This is the default unless the
.I dir\fB/modcanedit
file exists.
.TP 5
.B \-f
(Default.)
The information in the ``From:'' is extracted from subscribe confirm
messages and added to
.I dir\fB/Log
together with the subscriber address. This makes it easier for the list owner
to help a subscriber who cannot determine his/her subscription address. If the
.B \-S
switch is used, the information is instead extracted from the subscribe
request.
.TP 5
.B \-F
Ignore ``From:'' headers.
.TP 5
.B \-l
.B ezmlm-manage
will send a subscriber list in reply to the 
.I \-list
command and
the number of subscribers in reply to the
.I \-listn
comman if
.I dir\fB/modsub
or
.I dir\fB/remote
exist and target (the address the reply is to be sent to) is a moderator.
.TP 5
.B \-L
(Default.)
.B ezmlm-manage
will ignore the
.I \-list
and
.I \-listn
commands.  This is the default unless the
.I dir\fB/modcanlist
file exists.
.TP 5
.B \-m
For lists with moderated subscription, require moderator approval also
for unsubscribe requests. Remote admins are normally informed about
unsuccessful unsubscribes. This creates problems when there is more
than one moderator. Therefore, when the
.B \-m
switch is used, the notification is suppressed. Moderators can still
determine the result by using the
.I \-query
command.
.TP 5
.B \-M
(Default.)
Requests to unsubscribe from moderated lists do not require moderator approval.
.TP 5
.B \-n
(Default.)
Target addresses
will be notified if the are added or removed from the subscriber list.
.TP 5
.B \-N
Target addresses will not be notified if they are added/removed from the
subscriber list by remote admin or moderator action. Also, the target will
not be notified if they were successfully added/removed when the
.B \-S
and
.B \-U
switches, respectively, are used.
.TP 5
.B \-q
(Default.)
Quiet. The list-owner is not notified of subscription events.
.TP 5
.B \-Q
The list-owner is notified about failed unsubscribe attempts. Usually, these
are from subscribers that do not remember their subscription address and
require administrative assistance. Remote admins are notified when a unsubscribe
request initiated by them fails. Thus, the owner is not notified about these
events even if the
.B \-Q
switch is used.
.TP 5
.B \-QQ
As for
.BR \-Q ,
and in addition, the list-owner is notified about all additions to or removals
from the subscriber database. This is sometimes desired by owners of small
lists.
.TP 5
.B \-s
(Default.)
.B ezmlm-manage
will handle subscriptions with the normal target handshake.  This is the
default unless the
.I dir\fB/nosubconfirm
file exists.
.TP 5
.B \-S
.B ezmlm-manage
will eliminate the target handshake from the subscription
process. This allows anyone to subscribe anybody else. DO NOT use this
option, unless you know what you are doing. This option may be useful for 
some moderated lists.
.TP 5
.B \-u
(Default.)
.B ezmlm-manage
will handle unsubscribe requests with the normal target
handshake.  This is the default unless the
.I dir\fB/nounsubconfirm
file exists.
.TP 5
.B \-U
.B ezmlm-manage
will eliminate the target handshake from the unsubscription
process. This allows anyone to unsubscribe anybody else. DO NOT use this
option, unless you know what you are doing.
.TP 5
.B \-v
Display
.B ezmlm-manage
version information.
.TP 5
.B \-V
Display
.B ezmlm-manage
version information.
.SH "CHARACTER SETS"
If
.I dir\fB/charset
exists,
.B ezmlm-manage
will use the character set listed for all messages. Otherwise, the
default ``us-ascii'' will be used. The character set can be suffixed
by ``:'' followed by a code. If the code is ``Q'', outgoing messages are 
sent as ``Quoted-Printable'', if it is ``B'' they are sent ``base64'' encoded.
Otherwise, text is sent as is.

Incoming text for the
.I \-edit
is accepted unencoded or in either of these encodings.
.SH SUBSCRIPTIONS
If
.I action
is
.BR sc.\fIcookie ,
where
.I cookie
is an appropriate code
(depending on the target, the approximate time, and other factors),
.B ezmlm-manage
adds the target to the mailing list
if subscriptions are not moderated.
For subscription moderated lists,
.B ezmlm-manage
sends a confirmation request to the moderators with the right
.BR tc.\fIcookie
address in its response.
 
If
.I action
is
.B rc.\fIcookie
or
.BR tc.\fIcookie ,
where
.I cookie
is an appropriate code
(depending on the target, the approximate time, and other factors),
.B ezmlm-manage
adds the target to the mailing list. If the target was not already a
subscriber, a welcome message is sent to the target.

If
.I action
is
.BR subscribe ,
.B ezmlm-manage
does not subscribe the target,
but it identifies the right
.BR sc.\fIcookie
address in its response.

This confirmation mechanism
(1) verifies that the target is reachable 
and
(2) protects the target against forged subscription requests.

Actions of
.B uc.\fIcookie
and
.B unsubscribe
are used in the same way to delete the target from the mailing list.
Unsubscribes do not require moderator confirmation unless the
.B \-m
option is given.  Actions of
.B vc.\fIcookie
are used for moderator confirmation of unsubscribes.

Actions of
.B rc.\fIcookie
are used to confirm moderator-iniated subscribes for lists configured
with remote administration (see MODERATION).

Actions of
.B wc.\fIcookie
are used to confirm moderator-initiated unsubscribes for lists configured
with remote administration (see MODERATION).

If
.I action
is
.BR query ,
.B ezmlm-manage
returns a message to the target indicating whether or not the target address
is a subscriber.

If
.I action
is
.B info
or
.BR faq ,
.B ezmlm-manage
returns the contents of
.I dir\fB/text/info
or
.IR dir\fB/text/faq ,
respectively.

If
.I dir\fB/public
does not exist,
.B ezmlm-manage
rejects all subscription and unsubscription attempts.
However, if the list is configured with remote administration,
moderator-initiated subscribe and unsubscribe requests will still be
honored. Also, if
.I action
is
.IR help ,
.B ezmlm-manage
will still send help.
.SH "TEXT FILE EDITING"
If
.I action
is
.BR edit ,
either the
.B \-e
switch is used or the
.I dir\fB/modcanedit
file exists, and the target address is that of a remote administrator,
.B ezmlm-manage
will reply with a list of editable file in
.I dir\fB/text/
and instructions for editing. Cookies for editing expire approximately 27.8
hours after they are issued, or when a file has been changed, whichever is
sooner. The size of the updated file is limited to 5120 bytes.

If
.I action
is
.BR edit.\fIfile ,
the
.B \-e
switch is used, and the target address is that of a remote administrator,
.B ezmlm-manage
will return an editable copy of
.IR file .

If
.I action
is
.BR ed.\fIcookie ,
.B ezmlm-manage
will verify that the edit cookie is still valid and that the file has
not been modified since the cookie was issued. If the cookie passes
these tests,
.B ezmlm-manage
will update
.IR dir\fB/text\fI/file .
.SH "ARCHIVE RETRIEVALS"
If
.I action
is
.BR get.\fInum ,
.B ezmlm-manage
sends back message
.I num
from
.IR dir\fB/archive/ .
This can be disabled with the
.B \-C
command line switch.

If
.I dir\fB/public
does not exist,
.B ezmlm-manage
rejects all archive retrieval attempts.
.SH MODERATION
If
.I dir\fB/modsub
exists, subscriptions are moderated. Users can
unsubscribe without moderator action, but moderator confirmation is required
for subscriptions.

If
.I dir\fB/modsub
is not empty, it is assumed that the content this is the base
directory for the moderator database (
.IR moddir ).
Otherwise,
.I moddir
is assumed to be
.IR dir\fB/mod/ .
The given path must either be within
.I dir
or a relative directory name.

The moderator names are assumed
to be stored in a set of files in
.IR moddir\fB/subscribers/ .

To add, remove, and list moderators, use respectively:

.EX
.B ezmlm-sub
.I moddir
.IR user@host
.EE

.EX
.B ezmlm-unsub
.I moddir
.IR user@host
.EE

.EX
.B ezmlm-list
.I moddir
.EE

Subscription requests from potential
subscribers will be sent for a second round of confirmation to all the
moderators.
If a moderator approves the request, a message confirming the
subscription will be sent to the subscriber. The
subscriber will not know which moderator approved the subscription.

If more than one moderator replies to the confirmation request, the subscriber
will not receive duplicate messages about being on (or not on) the mailing list.

Unsubscribe requests from users are handled as for non-moderated lists.

All subscribe confirmation requests requiring moderator action have a subject of
.B CONFIRM subscribe to\fI listname@host.
All unsubscribe confirmation requests in reply to moderator-initiated
unsubscribe dialogs have a subject of
.B CONFIRM unsubscribe from\fI listname@host.

If
.I dir\fB/remote
exists (remote administration), moderators can initiate a request to
subscribe a user 'username@userhost' by sending mail to
.IR listname-subscribe\fB\-username=userhost\fI@host .
The moderator (not the subscriber) will receive the confirmation request,
and can complete the transaction. Moderators' request to unsubscribe
users are handled analogously. Once an address is successfully added to
or removed from the subscriber database by a moderator or remote admin,
the user is notified of the action. If a moderator or remote admin's subscribe
confirmation does not result in a change, i.e. if the address already was a
subscriber, no notification is sent. If a remote admin's
unsubscribe confirmation does not result in a change, i.e. the address was
not a subscriber, a notification is sent to the remote admin. This is to make
the remote admin aware that the address unsubscribed most likely is not the
subscriber's subscription address.

.I dir\fB/remote
is not empty, it is assumed that the content this is the base
directory for the moderator database (
.IR moddir ).
The moderator names are assumed
to be stored in a set of files in
.IR moddir\fB/subscribers/ .
The given path must either be within
.I dir
or a relative directory name.
If both
.I dir\fB/modsub
and
.I dir\fB/remote
exist, and both contain directory names, the directory name in
.I dir\fB/modsub
is used, and the
.I dir\fB/remote
entry is ignored.

It is possible to set up
a mailinglist for moderators only by using
.I dir\fB/mod/
as the list directory. Make sure that such a list is not public! Otherwise,
anyone can become a moderator by subscribing to this list.

If action is
.B \-help
and target is a moderator,
.B ezmlm-manage
will in addition to the usual help send
.I dir\fB/text/mod-help
containing instructions for moderators.

If action is
.B \-list
and target is a moderator, the list is set up for subscription moderation
or remote administration, and the
.I \-l
command line switch is used or the
.I dir\fB/modcanlist
file exists,
.B ezmlm-manage
will reply with an unsorted subscriber list. Extensions for digest subscribers
and auxillary databases are supported (see above).

If action is
.BR \-log ,
.B ezmlm-manage
will reply with the contents of the
.I Log
file with the same access restrictions as for the
.B \-list
action.
