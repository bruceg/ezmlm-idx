.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-cron
is a very restrictive interface to
.BR crond(8) .
It edits the effective user's ~/crontab (see crontab(5))
file. It then executes
.B crontab(1)
to update crond(8) with the changes.

.B ezmlm-cron
sets up the generation of trigger messages to the list
.I listadr
and the digest code
.IR code .
A optional digest format specifier
.I f
can be added to
.IR code .

.B ezmlm-cron
reads
.IR dir\fB/ezcronrc ,
where
.I dir
is the home directory of the effective user. The first line of this file is the
host name, 'host', to which bounces should be sent. Any bounces for lists
set up by 'user' will go to 'user@host'. Subsequent lines are entries
for users made up of:
.IR user:local:host:num:[list1[,list2...]] .
The ':'-separated parameters are:
.TP
.I user
the user name to which this line corresponds.
.TP
.I local
the list address must start with exactly these characters (case sensitive).
If this field is empty, any list local address is allowed.
.TP
.I host
the list host name must exactly match this parameter (case insensitive).
If this field is empty, any list host address is allowed. (Host names for
the list and the digest list must still match.)
.TP
.I num
the user is permitted a maximum of
.I num
entries.
.TP
.I list1 [,list2...]
a set of complete list names separated by commas. The user may edit
entries for these lists, even if they do not match the criteria set
above. If these lists exist, they are counted in determining
.IR num .
No while space is allowed before or between list names. If no list names
are specified, the final ':' can be omitted.

The first line matching the executing user will be used.

If
.B ezmlm-cron
is installed SUID
.IR euser ,
the configuration and crontab files from that user's home directory
will be used for all
.B ezmlm-cron
actions. This way, users on a system can be given limited
.B crond(8)
access via
.B ezmlm-cron
restricted by
.I dir\fB/ezcronrc
and to the generation of digest trigger messages. This is especially
useful for users without shell access or access to
.BR crond(8) .
.I euser
is usually 'ezmlm'.
To install
.B ezmlm-cron
SUID ezmlm:

.EX
  # chown ezmlm /usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-cron
  # chmod 4555 /usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-cron
.EE

.B ezmlm-cron
refuses to run if installed SUID root.
.B ezmlm-cron
when executed by 'root',
will still use the files in ~root.

To allow
.B crond(8)
access, you may need to list the effective user (all users allowed access
or ~ezmlm if
.B ezmlm-cron
is installed SUID ezmlm) in
.BR /etc/cron.allow .
See
.B crontab(1)
for further information.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.BR \-c ,
.BR \-d ,
and
.B \-l
switches are mutually exclusive.

.TP
.B \-c
List user entry from
.IR ezcronrc .
.TP
.B \-C
(Default.)
Do not list user entry.
.TP
.B \-d
Delete entry.
.B ezmlm-cron
will search
.I ~euser\fB/crontab
for an entry belonging to the executing user, permitted by
.I ~euser\fB/ezcronrc
and matching the command line arguments supplied.
.I code
is ignored and may be omitted.
.TP
.B \-D
(Default.)
Do not delete entry.
.TP
.B \-i\fI hrs
Generate trigger message with
.I hrs
hours interval. Accepted intervals are 0, 1 ,2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours.
Other numbers will be silently adjusted upwards to the nearest accepted
interval
(intervals above 72 hours will result in weekly trigger messages).
.TP
.B \-l
List entries. If no other command line arguments are given,
.B ezmlm-cron
lists the entries created in the name of the user. If
.I listadr
is given,
.B ezmlm-cron
will list the entries for all the matching lists, even if the entries
were not set up by the current user. Arguments, if given, still have to
comply with the rules set in
.IR ezcronrc .

Crude
.B crontab(5)
lines are listed. These are taken from the ~/crontab file. Usually,
these are active entries, although if the last execution of
.B crontab(1)
failed, they may not be.
.TP
.B \-L
(Default.)
Do not list entry.
.TP
.B \-t\fI hh:mm
The time for the trigger message. Other trigger messages will be sent
.I hrs
hours before and after this time.
.TP
.B \-w\fI dow
The days of the week on which trigger messages are sent. day 0 and 7 are
Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc (see crontab(5)). The string specified for
.I dow
must consists of single comma-separated digits in the range '0'-'7'
only. The default is every day, except for
.I hrs
of 48 (default Monday, Wednesday, Friday), 72 (default Monday and Thursday),
or greater than 72 (default Monday).
Both
.I hrs
and
.I dow
can be specified. In this case, trigger messages are sent
on the day specified by
.I dow
at the interval
specified by
.IR hrs .
If
.I hrs
is greater than 24 h, it is ignored and
trigger messages are generated daily or as specified by
.IR dow .
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ~euser/ezcronrc
The configuration file for
.BR ezmlm-cron .
.I euser
is the effective user id. This is the executing user, unless
.B ezmlm-cron
is installed SUID
.IR otheruser ,
in which case it is
.IR otheruser .
.TP
.I ~euser/crontab
The file edited by
.BR ezmlm-cron .
.I euser
is the effective user.
.TP
.I ~euser/crontabl
The lock file used to assure that only one process at a time is editing the
.B crond(8)
settings.
.I euser
is the effective user.
.SH BUGS
.B ezmlm-cron
should use the output of 'crontab -l' to list crontab lines, rather than
parse the crontab file (and assume that the last execution of
.B crontab(1)
was successful).
