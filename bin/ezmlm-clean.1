.SH NAME
ezmlm-clean \- clean moderation directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-clean [-mMrRvV]
.I dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-clean
sends out messages for timed-out posts in the moderation directory,
removes timed-out messages awaiting confirm,
and removes stubs for rejected and accepted posts
for the mailing list stored in
.IR dir .

.B ezmlm-clean
reads
.I dir\fB/modtime
and extracts a time-out ``time'' in hours from it. If ``time'' is 0 or
.I dir\fB/modtime
is empty or doesn't exist,
a default of 120 h is used. If a time is given, it is limited to
the range 24 h to 240 h.

.B ezmlm-clean
then looks through
.IR dir\fB/mod/accepted/ ,
.IR dir\fB/mod/rejected/ ,
.IR dir\fB/mod/unconfirmed/ ,
and
.I dir\fB/mod/pending/
and removes message stubs older than ``time''. ``Time'' is
a minimum retention time. Since the files are processed only
when
.B ezmlm-clean
is run, the delay before a message is timed-out may
be substantially longer if the list does not receive many messages.

Message age
determined by the time parsed
.I from the file name,
not from the creation time.
Thus, there is no good way to extend the life of
the file by e.g. touching it. Also, files in these directories are not
checked for the proper format. Thus, most non-message files in these
directories will be deleted the first time
.B ezmlm-clean
is run.

For messages in
.I dir\fB/mod/pending/
and
.IR dir\fB/mod/unconfirmed/ ,
no action is taken on read-only files. Messages without the owner execute
bit set are silently removed, as they are the result of incomplete
.B ezmlm-store(1)
executions.
For other messages in
.IR dir\fB/mod/pending/ ,
a notification of the time out is sent
to the sender, before the file is removed.
Messages in
.IR dir\fB/mod/unconfirmed/ ,
.IR dir\fB/mod/accepted/ ,
and
.I dir\fB/mod/rejected/
are silently removed.

.B ezmlm-clean
logs errors to the mail log.
Re-delivery should be avoided by suffixing any
.I \.qmail
line invoking
.B ezmlm-clean
with '|| exit 0'.

By default, the timed-out post is returned to the sender.  If
.I dir\fB/noreturnposts
exists, it switches the default to discard the timed-out post.
.B Note:
.B ezmlm-clean
is normally run from both
.I dir\fB/editor
and
.IR dir\fB/moderator .
To suppress sender notification, either
.I dir\fB/noreturnposts
needs to exist or the
.B \-R
option needs to be specified for all invocations of
.BR ezmlm-clean .

If
.I dir\fB/qmqpservers
exists,
.B ezmlm-clean will use
.B qmail-qmqp(1)
to send messages.

.SH "CHARACTER SETS"
If
.I dir\fB/charset
exists,
.B ezmlm-clean
will use the character set listed for all messages. Otherwise, the
default ``us-ascii'' will be used. The character set can be suffixed
by ``:'' followed by a code. If the code is ``Q'', outgoing messages are 
sent as ``Quoted-Printable'', if it is ``B'' they are sent ``base64'' encoded.
Otherwise, text is sent as is.
