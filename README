Like any other piece of software (and information generally), ezmlm-idx
comes with NO WARRANTY.

This software originated from ezmlm-0.53 (written by Dan J. Bernstein
and placed into the public domain).

ezmlm provided basic message distribution, subscriber address handling,
message archiving (single quoted message retrieval only), and bounce
handling. ezmlm-idx adds multi-message threaded archive retrieval, digests,
remote administration, message and subscription moderation, subscriber-only
restrictions, message trailer, subject prefix, subscriber name storage,
customizable setup, multi-language and MIME support and more. In addition,
improved bounce handling, case-insensitive subscriber address storage,
and support for distributed lists (main + sublist transparent to the
subscriber). Ezmlm-idx now includes optional support for MySQL or
PostgreSQL subscriber databases.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
See UPGRADE to upgrade from a previous version of ezmlm-idx.
See CHANGES to see what's new in this version.
See FILES for a list of files in this package.
See FAQ for more info on ezmlm(-idx) functions and setup (see below on
	    how to get the latest version).
See ezman-0.xx* for a user's/administrator's manual to ezmlm/idx. Available
	    on line at http://www.ezmlm.org/ and for download at
	    ftp://ftp.ezmlm.org/pub/patches/ezman/ and mirrors.

NOTE: Some ezmlmrc translations may not be up-to-date. ezmlm-make will
complain and the results may not match the documentation. Changes required
are small. If you correct a translation, please submit it for inclusion
in the next ezmlm-idx version.

*.rpm will put ezmlm-cgi in the bin directory. To use it, you must manually
move it to a cgi-bin directory, set ownership and SUID (if needed), and
set up /ezmlm/ezcgirc.

See http://cr.yp.to/ezmlm.html for the latest information about ezmlm.

as on-line versions of the FAQ and docs.
